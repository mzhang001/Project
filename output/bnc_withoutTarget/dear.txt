1991	Harsnet, he wrote, you have been seen doing circuit training with Korchnoi and the Brighton and Hove Albion football team.
1991	Harsnet, he wrote, you may be amused to hear that one of my sons spotted you the other day training with Korchnoi and the Brighton and Hove Albion football team.
1991	Dragging the pad towards him he found a clean page and wrote: Harsnet, I know you never answer my letters or return my calls, and I know that you handed over your notes to me on the understanding that I could do what I liked with them and not bother you, but I have to say that while there is much in them that I admire, as I will always admire much in you, no matter what, there is also much in them that seems to me to be puerile and, to put it mildly, bigoted.
1991	Harsnet, he wrote, tearing the sheet in his hurry to turn over the page, I know you never reply to letters and refuse to answer the door or the phone.
1991	Harsnet, he wrote, I am not sure if this will reach you and I know that even if it does you will not reply.
1991	Harsnet, he wrote, I want simply to tell you that work on your notes connected with the Big Glass is at last under way and that I have remained scholarly and impartial throughout what has not been an easy task, in view of what you say about me and especially about my family, and which you must have known would give offense.
1991	Harsnet, he wrote, just a brief note to let you know that work on the MSS you left with me is proceeding apace (at long last!) and will soon be ready for publication.
1991	Harsnet, he wrote, my son, who is a keen supporter of Brighton and Hove Albion Association Football Club (The Seagulls), and who frequently goes to the sports centre of the University of Sussex to watch his team at their indoor training, was surprised the other day to see two figures distinctly older than the rest of the players.
1991	Harsnet, he wrote, this is a message from the past.
1991	And Goldberg, in his pad: Harsnet, it may surprise you to hear that after all these years I am finally at work transcribing the notes you entrusted to me so many years ago, with a view to eventually publishing them.
1991	And Goldberg, pushing the typewriter from him, dragging the pad towards him, Harsnet, I am well aware of the fact that you have cut yourself off from all your old friends, and that you wish to have nothing more to do with them.
1991	Harsnet, he wrote, I am well aware of the fact that for some years now you have cut yourself off from your past and not deigned to reply to the letters of your friends, or even to return their calls, taking refuge in your answering machine and pretending not to be in when they rang at the bell.
1991	Harsnet, he wrote, it has taken me longer than I had at first anticipated to work my way through the manuscript you.
1991	Harsnet, he wrote, my son, who was only a very small boy  when you last saw him, happened the other day.
1991	Harsnet, he wrote, my son Michael, whom you may not even remember, the fair one with the glasses.
1991	Harsnet, he wrote, something happened recently which has prompted me to write to you in this unsolicited way, though God knows we were once.
1991	Harsnet, he wrote, why do you persist in this rigmarole of refusing even to acknowledge my existence?
1991	Harsnet, he wrote, the distance between London and Brighton is not very great, and you have even been seen in the vicinity of Brighton, so why not call in on an old friend?
1991	Moira, he wrote, we will have to reach an understanding.
1991	It is in our interests as designers in this field to ensure that the ‘pub tradition’ that we all hold so remains a living tradition.

1991	The immediate result is that alongside a few major clerics such as Runcie and Jenkins, we find that Stalker, Sampson, Anderton, Alderson, Newman, Imbert, , Oxford, and Hermon are national personalities, while a second division of chief officers regularly proclaim on a range of subjects which at other times would lie outside the province of the police.

1992	Mr Neville,
1983	My Proposition, embracing The House of the Dead, Notes from Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Possessed, Karamazov , and, negatively, by way of relative failure,The Idiot , is that Dostoevsky could only promote his values by creeping up on their blind side: in other words that he had an urge towards crisis and clarity which he could only satisfy by yielding it to the enemy — to the horror of the flogging routine in the ‘Thy kingdom come’ episode in the Dead House at one chronological extreme, and to Ivan Karamazov's showdown with the Religion Swindle at the other.
1983	The broader truth is that Dostoevsky cannot foster any of his values except obliquely, by stealth, by catching them napping.
1983	This is another instance of the novelist promoting his values by stealth.
1983	The thought of Dostoevsky fostering, however stealthily, his values, through Stepan on beauty, as through Shatov on new life, must be entertained in the context of the journalistic piece on Dobrolyubov:
1983	Stepan crystallizes this ‘something’ in Golyadkin and Quixote terms when he tells Mrs Stavrogin ‘You have always despised me; but I will end like a knight faithful to my lady, for your good opinion has always been to me than anything.’
1983	My chap, a different path lies before each man and no one of us can tell what road he may chance to follow.’

1991	As it is, he slyly suggests that minor artists may look down their noses at major ones and that ‘important’ work may be left to persons of an inferior kennel, like the Russians, the Germans, the Americans, who, poor , know no better.
1989	‘If I die abroad in exile, let my body rest in a temporary grave until my mortal remains be transferred to our homeland,’ said the Montenegrin President, Branko Kostic, reading the royal will and testament to the crowds in Cetinje Square, who carried flags and portraits of Nicholas and his queen, Milena.

1989	Between July 1988, when it is now known the department knew of at least seven cases, and August 1989, when Geoffrey , the Chief Constable of the West Midlands, purged his CID department — moving 39 serving and former squad officers into administrative roles — at least two more men were convicted on the basis of disputed confession evidence.
1989	Mr has said he did not take earlier action because he was told there was no evidence to suggest a wider conspiracy.

1991	Manning lists numerous categories employed in a London subdivision, such as‘old boots’, ‘old ’, ‘cows’, ‘slags’, ‘greasers’, ‘John Does’, and ‘yobs’(1977: 236–8).

1991	Again local knowledge is used, for example, to classify specific pensioners as either ‘old ’ or ‘old biddies/dolls’, and the categorization is often negotiated between the police concerned on this basis.

1991	Through his efforts in this direction he effectively mocks much that is to scholars, historians, literary critics and art historians, especially the concept of a clear chronological sequence: his answer to the problem of how a Mexican can ‘belong’ to the dynasty of European art is, as it were, to invade it retrospectively.

1990	Similarly, a Norfolk farm boy ‘used to spend a lot of time’ with his labouring grandparents: ‘a old cupple, and I was very fond of them and they of me, and would never hear anything wrong of me’, although he was already in trouble with the authorities.
1990	Auntie Kate, as they called the old wife, proved ‘a old soul, and of course the old boy, he used to tell us all stories about over the sea.’
1990	Oh yes, she was a very very strict old .’
1992	It was an easy entry into conversation and, after going through the statistics to a teacher's heart (hours per week -twenty-five: pupils in a class — thirty), I asked him about the problems of teaching Spanish here.
1992	‘We must meet reverses boldly, not suffer them to frighten us, my .
1991	The fault, reader, is not in our leaders, but in our system, that we are underlings.
1989	‘Franca, , wouldn't you like to go and lie down,’ came Moxie's voice.
1989	‘It's too late,’ said Moxie, and said to Franca, ‘do go and rest, .
1989	Alison said to Franca, ‘I'm going now, Franca.’
1989	‘Pat, , can't you just decide to give up drink, can't that be part of the new life you're always talking about?
1989	‘And now, Alfred , please go.’
1989	She said in a gentle voice, ‘Go now, Jack, see you tomorrow.’
1989	me, thought Franca, then perhaps I might be in danger of actually becoming as saintly as I seem!
1989	‘Of course, Ludens.
1989	‘No, thanks, Franca, , let's just sit down and be quiet together.’
1989	‘Ludens, Alfred, old friend, don't get fixated on that man, there's nothing left in him, he's an empty shell.
1989	‘Franca, I can't — Oh — I promised Irina I'd go over and help her pack — I said I'd stay all day — they're leaving, you know —’
1989	‘Oh , oh , I can't , we're supposed to be leaving tomorrow, or the day after, if we can get everything ready, there's so much to do.
1989	‘I don't hate you, Alison.’
1989	‘Alison, my , don't bother me so.’
1989	Oh, my —’ Alison suddenly reached out a long brown arm.
1989	‘Patrick, ,’ said Franca, ‘Alison and I have decided to run away together.’
1989	We could all live together nearby in different cottages and be friends.’
1989	‘No, no, keep it, Pat.
1989	‘Oh, Pat, !’
1989	Now could you just do me a cup of tea, Irina ?’
1990	Both began ‘Madam’, and both were unsigned.
1990	Madam,
1990	I know you go out in company very little, and was the more fortunate that Crabb managed to entice you to his breakfast table.
1990	Madam,
1990	I know you go out in company very little, and was the more fortunate that Crabb managed to entice you to his breakfast table.
1990	I know that you came only to honour Crabb, at a small informal party, because he had been of assistance to your illustrious father, and valued his work at a time when it meant a great deal to him.
1990	‘Madam, Since our extraordinary conversation, I have thought of nothing else.’
1990	‘Madam, Since our pleasant and unexpected conversation I have thought of little else.’
1990	Ash had never met Miss LaMotte, who indeed came out exceptionally to please me and to speak of her Father, whose Mythologies I have had some hand in bringing before the English public.
1990	I too desired to be at home, and was glad when we were able to close our own front door behind us, and be gathered in to the silence of our little parlour.
1990	When I think of my previous existence — of all I thought I could reasonably expect of the rest of my life, an allowed place at the extreme corner of someone's drawing-room carpet, a Servant's garret or no better, I give thanks for every little thing, which is unspeakably to me.
1990	And she kissed me, and called me her Blanche, and said I knew she was a good girl, and very strong, and not foolish.
1990	‘You should be ashamed to believe that,’ said Fergus, ‘and you so wise and clever about every other thing, my .’
1990	And I said — for I was permitted to answer — that I had no desire for marriage, but wished to live unwed and happy with my brother and no other.
1990	I said that without my brother I had little care where I was, and no one I wished to speak to.
1990	And you may ask yourselves, my and most innocent readers, whether he spoke there with more gentleness or cunning, since the lady set such store on giving herself of her own free will, and since also the castle with its gardens, though now measurable with pins and fine stitches and thumbnails and thimbles, were lordly and handsome enough for any man to wish to spend his days there.
1990	George , I have had an adventure and been rescued by a knight.
1990	‘We'll bring you back any treasure we find, : If you wait.’
1990	Miss LaMotte,
1990	It was a great pleasure to talk to you at Crabb's breakfast party.
1990	Mr Ash,
1990	Randolph,
1990	My ,
1990	‘So you shall, my ,’ said his wife.
1990	‘Oh , are you sure, Alex?
1990	‘Oh , where shall I find him then?’
1990	‘Oh , you and your girlfriends…well, perhaps Tory could come too?’ she looked enquiringly at Marie, who admitted that Victoria had been considered too young to ride by her parents.
1990	In a clipped, reconstituted Oxford accent he called his colleagues ‘old chap,’ and ‘my fellow.’
1990	I can do the work OK, they're giving me really good grades, which is more than my dumb sister.
1990	Oh .
1990	‘It's a very long way, , and bound to be boggy at this time of year.
1990	‘Sister mine, , sister,’ he said comfortingly, ‘that was a damn-fool thing to do.
1990	Come then, my .
1990	And you will, sister Elizabeth, won't you?’
1990	‘Of course, brother John.
1990	‘Thank you, my .’
1990	Never let that rub at your heart, my .
1990	Poor Hugh's face was somehow much less vivid than the tall hennins a married lady could wear, that gave her extra height.
1990	‘He'll be fine in a few days, my , with an infusion of clover and foxglove to steady his heart.
1990	Elizabeth, my , we'll have to see to that at once.’
1990	Elizabeth, , we'll have to see about training a new cook.’
1990	But she will do her duty — won't you, my ?’
1990	Mother, mother, she knew already exactly where she'd start!
1990	‘I pray you remember, mother, that it is I who am Lady of Duart.
1990	No, no, my !
1990	God, who would ever have thought, looking at the insignificant scrap, that she could affect the world more than a dry leaf?
1990	God!
1990	‘She's no more beautiful than yourself, my .
1990	‘What do you want to do, my ?’
1990	‘A nettle stings if you brush it lightly, sister.
1990	You've not hurt your head, have you, my ?
1990	‘I'm sure you will, my !’ he praised her.
1990	I thank you for setting me right, my .’
1990	God preserve you, my , lad.’
1990	There are such men in this city, and even to see them, never mind to touch them or have them kiss you, or see them just before dawn, or to have them as one of your friends, is one of the great pleasures of our life, and it is commoner than most people think.
1990	And suddenly we'd all be in Amsterdam or Paris or something like somebody's idea of America for the evening, or else it would still be our own city, but from very definitely another era, all striped Regency wallpaper and framed Angus McBean photographs of Vivien Leigh; or another time there'd be nothing but opera on the sound system for a whole week, there'd be complaints of course but Madame would say,I'm just trying to give you boys an education , and Gary at least would be very happy.
1990	Some of the letters were in ballpoint, some in a big fat lazy hand in heavy black ink, only twenty-six words on the page, some typed (some well-typed, some mis-typed); but despite these differences, each letter began with the same phrase:My Boy .
1990	They formed a sequence, dated from 1903 to 1927, detailing the changing fashions of that period —my , we never showed our legs like that.
1990	There had been no attempt to make these signatures credible; the words ‘for my and especial Boy, with affectionate regards from Mr Arthur Bloxam’ appeared across a faded nineteenth-century portrait; but they also appeared scrawled lavishly across a portrait of an eighteen-year-old boxer torn from the sports pages of a recent newspaper.
1990	Boy did not keep in this box the letters that arrived once a week at his flat, regularly, on a Tuesday morning, letters which also began ‘Boy’ or ‘My Boy’, but which were all signed ‘Father’.
1990	But even when they were famous names like those, Madame used to recite or whisper them like they were the names of lovers or at least the departed, girlfriends, people she had actually met.
1990	One more story about O: he told me (it was as if he was trying to explain the oddity of his lovemaking to me, as if he was trying to account for or apologise for the way he'd treated me, or perhaps to reassure me concerning the effect he'd had on me, I don't know), in the morning he told me that there was one man, this had been just a couple of years previously, there was one man who had summoned him to his bedside to be counted amongst a farewell gathering of lovers, friends and great passions.
1990	My Boy,
1990	My Boy, my greatest fear is not that I shall never again touch you, but that when I return I shall no longer be able to hear your voice.
1990	I fear, my , that I going deaf…
1990	Boy
1990	Boy, It must be very difficult for you sometimes I expect not having anyone and having to do all the shopping and cooking for yourself I know that when I was working I certainly could not have managed on my own, coming home tired and then making dinner your own dinner and then going upstairs to do some more work, what sort of life is that, though I know all about that because of course I did do that for three years almost, and I know how much happier I was when I knew there was someone waiting for me and having the dinner ready and keeping the house clean and all those things, or perhaps you people don't think those things are important.
1990	Occasionally when she was wearing this she had a trick of lifting it like wings, or ruffling it as if it was her real plumage, and she'd declare: ‘My , I am preparing for The Flight — into Egypt, to the islands, to the New World — who knows!’
1989	Mustn't speak ill of our allies.’

1991	‘Ooh, I don't think we should go in there, .
1991	The Report on Handsworth captures this image and links it to the social condition of young blacks:
1991	(, 1985, p. 69)
1991	This was an argument put most succinctly by Geoffrey , Chief Constable of the West Midlands (, 1985) and by Douglas Hurd, the Home Secretary, in relation to Handsworth.
1991	Numerous examples of this line of argument can be found in 's report on Handsworth, and in press coverage during the riots.
1991	Second, just as 's image of a few hundred ‘young black criminals’ was used to explain what happened in Handsworth, the problem of drugs was used to explain what happened at a national level.
1991	The Chief Constable for the West Midlands, Geoffrey , took this argument further by pointing out that the day before the riots a successful carnival had taken place, with the support of local community leaders.
1990	‘All right, ?
1990	Which I most certainly am not, as nearest and , and gangs of so-called friends will confirm.
1990	‘Now , we don't have a gaff or net, so I will show you how to tail a salmon,’ he said, unctuously.
1990	There was ‘in the English constitution an absence of those declarations or definitions of rights so to foreign constitutionalists’, but this was a strength rather than a weakness; whereas ‘general rights guaranteed by the constitution may be, and in foreign countries, constantly are, suspended’, the English emphasis on specific remedies protected by legislation and the courts meant that ‘the suspension of the constitution, as far as such a thing can be conceived possible, would mean with us nothing less than a revolution’.

1988	‘It won't be necessary, Agnes ,’ said Dorothy, in the firm tones of a headmistress.
1988	‘Then you go over to school, ,’ said Miss Fogerty, ‘and I'll see to the breakfast things.’
1988	She had had more help and affection from her old Agnes than ever Ray and Kathleen had shown her.

1988	‘You poor !
1988	‘Oh , I'm sure you're over-tired!
1988	I must go and break it to Dimity, and then we must clear up things here, and set off for Thrush Green without delay.’

1991	The traveller who rides on a local bus can learn a lot: in the mountains of Greece everyone clings on for life and makes the sign of the cross at every bend in the road; in the Thar Desert, Rajasthan, a sense of humour is essential, especially when the giggling driver moves the sheltering bus to reveal squatting passengers answering the call of nature, and in South America it helps if you don't mind sitting next to a chicken or sharing the floor with a goat.
1991	Things don't always work out as well as that: ‘Sir,’ wrote a client to a Thomas Cook branch manager in 1965, ‘Will you please cancel travel arrangements made by Mr — for October 3rd as the wedding has been cancelled because he is already married.’
1991	‘My fellow…’
1991	‘Oh years, fellow, years and years.
1991	Only place to be, fellow, only place to be.’
1991	And as for London: ‘The end, my fellow, the absolute end.’
1991	‘And you, fellow, what brings you to this city?’
1991	Sandison was already getting tired of being addressed as ‘fellow’.
1991	‘My , fellow, if I had a lira for every time I've heard that story…well…’
1991	He would not have bought it had he been by himself but Maidstone assured him it was the right choice —‘Absolutely first rate, fellow.’

1990	‘No ,’ said Henry.
1990	Mr Farr,
1990	They didn't start ‘Henry’, or ‘My Husband’, but simply began, picking up (as her therapist had taught her) at ‘the moment of rage’.
1990	A pint mug, my ?
1990	‘Yes, !’ said Henry.
1990	For a moment, Henry thought it would be another few thousand words on the subject of his obscene masculinity, but to his surprise he saw it began ‘Elinor…’
1990	ELINOR,
1990	Because you are !

1988	The so-called ‘Loony Left’, much invoked before the general election of June 1987, was in some places responsible if not for vagaries in the total school curriculum, then at least for the expenditure of scarce resources on teachers, and publications, dealing with subjects to their hearts, like racism, sexism, and peace-studies, unpopular with government and with many parents.

1983	Sam dropped his gaze thoughtfully to Midnight's teeth tearing at his grass, and knew that his old bike was doomed.
1983	God!…for a moment she thought of Gloria and Seb cosily entwined in the plush seats of the centrally-heated Roxy.
1983	‘Hullo, !’
1983	‘Oh, do lend me your anorak, Seb ,’ Nutty said, and he nobly took it off and handed it over.
1983	Find some clothes, there's a .’

1990	She finished her ladling and pushed the plate of mutton stew and dumplings towards Agnes; then, the ladle held above the casserole dish, she was about to dip it in again when Agnes said in an offhand manner, ‘What a pity you aren't a widow, Mother, you could have had Henry yourself.’
1990	Oh, me!’— she was looking at the casserole dish —‘stewed mutton and dumplings.
1990	And think of a life ahead sitting at a machine tapping out: ‘Sir, At your request I am forwarding twenty barrels of salted herring to your wife's boudoir.
1990	She now flapped her hand as if shooing something away, then went out of the kitchen and onto the landing, and here, as she had before, she stopped, but only long enough to raise her eyes to the whitewashed ceiling as her mind said, God, don't let anything come of this.
1990	She looked up, adding now, ‘The chocolate is always .
1990	She rose from the chair, muttering to herself, ‘Oh !’ because she knew she would have to make her way to the closet at the far end of the house.
1990	Oh , why was she so miserable?
1990	But as she was passing the Misses Cardings' shop she heard a loud tapping on the upper part of the door; then it was pulled open and Miss Belle Carding beckoned Agnes towards her, saying, ‘Come in a minute, .
1990	You have, .’
1990	And now they all nodded towards Agnes and Miss Florence said softly, ‘The moment we got it, , I said, ‘I know who that would suit, because she has the same figure as Mrs Bretton-Fawcett.’
1990	‘You've got a lovely waist, .
1990	But, you know, you three people have changed all that: you've brought something new into my life with that beautiful dress and coat.’
1990	You know nothing about women, my Charles.
1990	There was another roar of laughter when the old lady, her voice changing, said, ‘All right, I will behave, not because you tell me to but because our Henry here will die of shock in a moment.’
1990	She hoped it wouldn't be longer; she hoped it would be less, for as as Aunt Nessy was, she always brought a feeling of change and unrest into this quiet and well-ordered household.
1990	‘Oh, you're exaggerating, my .’
1990	But you see, the Reverend has a distant relative whom he means to put in my place and so I was granted sick leave over the holiday in order that his Jonathan could come and assist him with the Christmas services.

1990	So when referring to me in future, brother, remember that although I wear the cloth, Henry George Farrier is still underneath it.’
1990	The father is downstairs and by the sound of it your husband, and my father, has just killed him.’
1990	Oh God!
1990	She was pressing it for life now as if she was in a panic, and she kept her finger on it until, through the glass door, she saw the flicker of a candle weaving its way down through the shop.
1990	‘Oh! my , you're shivering.
1990	Upstairs, she put a shawl around Agnes, saying, ‘There you are, .
1990	Oh, you don't know anything about the plans he had for his daughter, and you stand there and talk of her marrying a man from the lowest scum family in Newcastle.
1990	God in heaven!’
1991	True, giving him pride of place entails an insulting belittlement of her passionate romantic friendships with women; not least the one she maintained for more than thirty years with Sue Gilbert, her Other, and eventually — bitter blow — her sister-in-law.

1993	Now Lizzy had taken all that her grandmother held and dragged it through the dirt.
1989	Jane Austen is less descriptive than either the Gothic novelists or Scott, for although her letters are full of domestic detail and she enjoins her sister, Cassandra, to omit nothing in her account of a house —‘For one's own self, one ascertains & remembers everything’— novels are not written for ‘one's own self’, and she was not one to inflict what she did not enjoy —‘your descriptions are often more minute than will be liked’, she warns her niece, Anna Austen, an aspiring writer.

1989	Moreover, when Dickens alludes in Bleak House to ‘a hemmed-in churchyard, pestiferous and obscene, whence malignant diseases are communicated to the bodies of our brothers and sisters who have not departed’, he is not being metaphorical.
1992	Swamps of wild rush-beds and sloughs' squashy traces, Grounds of rough fallows with thistle and weed, Flats and low vallies of kingcups and daisies, Sweetest of subjects are ye for my reed: Ye commons left free in the rude rags of nature, Ye brown heaths beclothed in furze as ye be, My wild eye in rapture adores every feature, Ye are as this heart in my bosom to me.
1992	I would not forsake ye, I would not forsake you for sweetest of scenes: For sweetest of gardens that nature could make me I would not forsake ye, valleys and greens: Tho' Nature ne'er dropped ye a cloud-resting mountain, Nor waterfalls tumble their music so free, Had Nature denied ye a bush, tree, or fountain, Ye still had been loved as an Eden by me.

1991	Urry's (1981) discussion of The Anatomy of Capitalist Societies similarly uses a threefold schema — of economy, civil society and state: economy covers the sphere of production, wherein material needs are met; civil society ‘is that site where individual subjects reproduce their material conditions of life’(p. 6); and the state is that apparatus which, as Clark  and (1984) argue, concurrently sustains the sphere of production, by promoting accumulation strategies in a capitalist society, regulates the sphere of consumption in civil society, and, through the propagation of an ideology, welds the two in a social consensus.
1982	The breach with the inherited system lay not in Godoy's policies but in the relegation to impotence of the trained bureaucrats who had been the servants of Charles III; it lay in the scandalous origins and untrammelled nature of his power as the queen's supposed lover and the ‘friend’ of the complaisant Charles IV.
1982	By 1808 the unpopularity of Godoy had spread beyond these circles to embrace all classes and the revolution prophesied in 1798 was turning against the court that supported his power: a monarchy which could disgrace itself and by its foreign policy plunge Spain into inflation, bread, commercial depression, and the loss of the American market must be limited by a constitution.

1960	She scooped some underwear off a chair and said,"Sit down, .
1960	I noticed that she was very modest in front of me, going through mild contortions putting on her undies beneath her dressing-gown, and once when it fell off, revealing her shabbily but quite decently clad in a mauve rayon slip, she snatched it up with a quick "Sorry " .
1960	You don't mind if  I throw you out now, do you, ?
1960	Standing outside in the gloom of the area she said, quite naturally,"You go ahead, , and I'll follow you after a minute or two.
1960	There was a baffled pause, and then James said, in a worried voice,"Jane , you're not really ill, are you?

1992	‘Too much to tell you, boy,’ said Elinor gaily.
1992	Oh .
1992	‘You make it sound quite fun, boy.
1992	Stop fretting, boy.’
1992	‘Don't worry, boy,’ Elinor said over a glass of champagne poured from one of the little bottles.
1992	This old , who was to be kept under heavy sedation, clearly didn't know that she was a long-term patient, being treated for depression.
1992	Lean forward a bit, — you've pushed your cushion down again.
1992	‘, Buzz.
1993	How are you, my ?’
1993	‘Oh , oh , I'm so sorry, Mr Tucker.’
1993	‘So soon, Mrs Sutherland?’ and, ‘Oh .
1993	me.
1993	‘There, there, my , there, there.
1993	There's a .
1984	(Even if one as as her , brother, Harry.)
1984	‘Harry, Harry — go on.
1984	Harry.
1984	‘My Miss Greene, may I introduce a new, but very fervent admirer…’
1984	(‘…As my brother said only last week, evenings spent with actresses…’)
1984	The band played little Jappy Jap Jappy , and The Amorous Goldfish from last year's hit,The Geisha .
1984	Sir Robert, he had heard too, leaning forward said gallantly, ‘You shall, my , you shall.’
1984	‘Lord, I have lost it, you know.
1984	Vicky — larger than life (too large for little life…)
1984	‘Oh God — I must take your name in vain.
1984	But at once she was warmly sympathetic, giving directions to the cabby, then, clutching my arm: ‘Oh my ,’ she said, ‘we are both in such trouble.’
1984	(And God, I thought, if this show doesn't go on, I shall lose my chance…)
1984	Then, ‘And you, , what shall you do?’
1984	‘Does it worry you, ?’
1984	But two evenings later, as I stood in the wings about to go on, she came off stage and, separating from the others, clutching my arm, she whispered, ‘Lily, Lily, — the worst, it is all the worst —’ Her eyes, against the wet white, the rouge, were large, frightened.
1984	Then: ‘No, you thing, you may not come too…’
1984	‘And I too, .
1984	Tell me, —‘
1984	Lily, ,what will become of me ?
1984	My , friend.
1984	It is called an only child, my …’
1984	Each letter, and how many there seemed now, for she had kept each note, even the hastiest (‘half past two a.m., , I have been away from you only fifteen minutes and already I am dreaming of my Lily and our next happy meeting!’).
1984	, I know that when I am away my darling goes out with others.
1984	I wish, , that I was a poet and not just a silly twenty-three-year-old man about town…
1984	I know, , that you could take a holiday this summer — You mentioned it would be possible.
1984	His face, the vivacity dimmed but shining with affection, with anxiety to please.
1984	Perhaps I wasn't able to say earlier this evening, when your sweet face was looking at me.
1984	I could not say how very , very much I am going to miss my — except that I know she will understand.
1984	I cannot, , do this very often.
1984	‘Colonel, please, the name of your solicitors?
1984	My Miss Greene, cases of this nature…’ he rubbed his hands.
1984	I know I should not allow one of my friends to discover so late on of my romantic attachment….
1984	And so goodbye,friend of my youth — for now I am no longer the boy you knew, but a man …
1984	He was an elderly bachelor (‘I shall never marry, my ,’) and also very rich.
1984	They ate by candlelight (‘Electricity, my , is so cruel,’ Lionel told Mrs Beeley), and from where she sat throughout the meal she could feel his gaze, steady, as if he took the image of her inwards.
1984	‘And that she gets from your self.
1984	You, , really must marry soon.
1984	‘But Alice , yes — that one.
1984	‘But first, my , Nice.
1984	Frankly, Lily, I saw too many of them last year…’
1984	‘Good night, my …’
1984	‘My , oh but yes — pardon, pardon — what shall we say?
1984	‘My ,’ said Lionel, stifling a yawn, ‘who would want to write three hundred thousand words on a postcard?
1984	, I don't ask very much.
1984	‘No, my ,no .’
1984	‘Oh ,’ and he yawned again.
1984	She was little thing, not pretty,jolie laide , it is big loss they have…’
1984	Sophie said, ‘Oh my .’
1984	And your mother, , in Heaven, will understand.’
1984	Only Fräulein, Fräulein, with her moon face, her hair in that absent-minded crooked bun, only she could be relied on.
1984	‘Alice, , just the very person.
1984	Poor Mr Nicolson…’
1984	I was her mother's friend…a special relationship….
1984	At the end of one day's shooting, Teodor said to Robert: ‘My fellow, you shoot us — soon, yes?’
1984	‘Let me show you, , in the atlas…’
1992	Oh, me, no.
1992	But don't reprimand yourself too  much, my .
1992	‘Or what, Mother ?
1992	It was not an errand she would enjoy, because she knew the sorrow it would cause, but her specific task in this household was to be the eyes and ears of her companion.
1992	In that one respect only she had failed her friend.
1992	Oh, me, no.’
1992	She needed to live his life with him, if only through the eyes and ears of her friend.
1992	Through him…through you, my friend, I have a purpose in living.’
1992	For a brief moment, she actually thought he would defy the old man, but then her heart sank when he sheepishly replied, ‘Perhaps it would be for the best, .’
1992	There you are, my .’
1992	‘Oh !’ said Meg.
1992	Raoul
1993	‘God Almighty, have pity.
1993	‘God, what's happened?’
1993	‘Language, !’
1993	Come along, my , we must go home.’
1993	Holding her head high she met his gaze, saying simply, ‘Don't be silly, .
1993	‘All on your own, ?’ she said, when she unlocked the door.
1993	‘Thank you, .’
1993	‘If you would, , then I can weigh out some packets of tea.
1993	‘Oh , more bills from the wholesalers, by  the looks of them.
1993	‘You've gone quite pale, .
1993	‘Oh , Marcus said we must all try and forget about Tommy.
1993	‘My darling, I don't know whether I should be writing this to you, but I still think of you every day of my life, first thing when I wake up and last thing before I go to sleep.
1993	Wait for me, my darling You are mine and I am yours.
1993	‘Oh , it's so unfortunate….’
1993	‘Anyhow,you're looking very nice, my .
1993	‘How about a nice cup of tea, ?’ said Emily, filling the teapot.
1993	‘She's only telling you for your own good, ,’ Emily interposed.
1993	‘me!’
1993	‘It can't be helped, .
1993	Oh , I should have realised.
1993	There was a silence, and then Rosie said huskily, ‘God, what a thing to ask.
1993	‘Charmed to be making your acquaintance, lady.’
1993	Whatever will the lady think of you?
1993	I could do a lot for you, my .’
1993	‘Rosie, my , could I have a word with you in the kitchen?’
1993	Mr Kleiber, I have been requested by a client to approach you, concerning a matter of business.
1993	‘My , you must be in the picture as well.
1993	‘My sir, you must not tell me what I do or do not mean.
1993	In fact I happened just to have spent the weekend with a friend and was well aware that at some point over the two days she had entertained everyone suspected of being concerned, and not a word of politics was discussed, nor a syllable about supplanting anybody.
0000	‘Oh , oh !’ said Mrs Lynde.
0000	And we'll keep our old Green Gables!
1992	‘Very pretty, my .
1992	‘Miss Havisham!’ said one of the ladies lovingly.
1992	‘I don't want to talk too much about my feelings, but — well — I often lie awake at night thinking of you, Miss Havisham!’
1992	‘Matthew never comes to see Miss Havisham.
1992	The ladies and gentlemen went slowly out of the room, some protesting quietly that they had not seen enough of their relation.
1992	old Joe simply could not believe his eyes when he and I entered Miss Havisham's room the next day.
1992	good Joe!
1992	‘Well, I love old Joe more than anyone else, but his education and manners could be improved.’
1992	‘My friend, if you will allow me to call you that,’ he cried, shaking both my hands, ‘let me congratulate you on your fortune!
1992	‘Don't worry, trust me, my friend.
1992	‘My Pip,
1992	‘Pip, old boy, life is full of so many goodbyes.
1992	And so God bless you, Pip, old boy, God bless you!’
1992	I am sorry to say I did not think about , good Joe at all.
1992	‘But I want to ask you something, my Handel,’ said Herbert, looking serious for once.
1992	‘Joe, how are you?’
1992	‘Pip, old boy, you knew her when she was a fine woman…’ and he could say no more.
1992	‘May I, my sir?
1992	I never had an hour's happiness with her, but I still thought about her, day and night, and my wish was to marry her.
1992	‘Yes, Pip, boy, I've made a gentleman of you!
1992	boy, I kept myself going, you see, through all the hard work, just by thinking of you.
1992	‘All I want is to stand and look at you, boy!’ he said.
1992	‘boy, who knows I'm here?
1992	‘My Handel,’ he said, ‘if you want to pay back what you owe him, you could always join my company, Clarrikers.
1992	‘boy!’ he said, putting his hand on my shoulder as he sat down heavily in the boat.
1992	‘You don't know what a pleasure it is to me, Pip,’ he said once, ‘to be with my boy, in the open air.’
1992	‘I hope so, boy.
1992	‘boy,’ he said, ‘you're never late.’
1992	‘Thank you, boy.
1992	You've never deserted me, boy!’
1992	‘Magwitch, listen to me.
1992	old Joe seemed just the same, but as I got better, he began to remember I was a gentleman, and call me sir again, and when I got up one morning, I discovered he had gone.
1992	‘Biddy,’ I said, ‘you have the best husband in the whole world.’
1992	‘And Joe, you have the best wife in the world, and she will make you as happy as even you deserve to be, good Joe!’
1992	‘Oh old Pip,’ said Joe, ‘God knows we forgive you, if there is anything to forgive!’
1992	‘Pip,’ said Biddy quietly to me after supper, ‘have you quite forgotten her ?
1992	‘My Biddy, I can never forget her.
0000	I said, ‘but thank you for warning me, my friend.’
0000	We arrived home at last on April 13th, 1702, and I saw my wife and children again.
0000	He listened so politely that I perhaps talked a little too much about my country.
0000	I had to listen patiently, while he was giving his extraordinary opinions of my country.
0000	And so, two months later, although I was very sad to leave, I said goodbye to my master and his family, and rowed away from the land of the Houys.
1992	Red-figure turns out to combine the silhouette-principle, to vase-decorators for its strength on the curved surface, with the freedom of outline drawing; and this encourages its practitioners to look outside the closed tradition of their craft to the work of painters on flat surfaces (cf. fig. 45, painted perhaps about the time of red-figure's inception).
1993	He was such a old thing, although she had heard a rumour about him and Sylvia.
1993	‘It shows, my .
1993	‘No, my , we have something rather special in store for you.
1993	‘Oh, .
1993	‘Oh ,’ he said.
1993	Secondly, a friend of mine has gone wandering off with a person I'm fairly sure is addicted to a very nasty personality altering drug.
1993	‘me, no,’ he said.
1993	‘Oh ,’ he said flippantly as he caught sight of the Cell, floundering helplessly in the carrying case.
1993	‘My boy.’
1993	‘Then, fellow, make with the stuff, bring forth a get-up, lay on the gear, give us a decent hit for the love  of Mike, for by Zeus I am surely clucking fit to bust.’
1993	‘You remember him, ?’
1988	Then a nurse and officer came and said, ‘Come along, , we're taking you to another wing.’
1988	There's one kept saying, ‘If there's anything wrong, , you know you can always come to me to talk about it.’
1990	The servants did not want to offend their young master, and Mrs Reed could see no fault in her boy.
1990	I was busy and happy all that time, relying greatly on the help and encouragement of my friend Miss Temple.
1990	‘My , don't mention governesses to me!’ cried Lady Ingram, holding a white hand to her forehead.
1990	‘How are you, aunt?’
1990	Mrs Reed,
1990	‘aunt,’ I said, ‘don't think about that any more.
1990	‘Goodbye, my master!’
1990	Oh, my poor master — once almost my husband — who I had often called ‘my Edward’!
1993	For, even in these difficult times, he still holds the thought of League football arriving at ‘The Tip’.
1993	God, I must give up drink.

1992	friend,
1992	Now, Frank, when will our wedding be?’
1992	But Bathsheba, mistress, think of your position!
1992	He stole your heart away with his lies.
1992	‘Say the words, my one, and I won't speak about it any more.

1972	ABBERLEY: My love, you make yourself sound so old.
1972	God.
1972	MAX: My Abberley.
1972	PEG (to Max ): , you can see he is making an effort.
1972	My , the time we had — it wasn't what we meant.
1972	MAX: Oh , now you're going to get upset.
1972	My friends, this is it, yes?
1972	‘Oh .
1972	‘Do you need one of your pills, ?’
1972	I'm sorry, my .’
1972	‘My Miss Nib,’ he said, hurling himself out of bed and into the bathroom, ‘take a letter.
1972	‘Oh ,’ I said.
1972	O.K., not, but for Christ's  sake go out and enjoy yourself, my .
1972	Oh .’
1972	‘I'm going for a walk ,’ he said, absently.
1972	After a pause, while she knitted and changed to a new ball of wool, she surprisingly said, ‘Oh .’
1972	My friend.’
1972	‘My girl,’ Emily said, worried.
1972	‘Oh .
1993	But I don't want that sort of marriage — no disrespect to your Sol, sister !
1993	He remembered every word: Mr Cohen, Do you know that your son Jacob is going with a Christian girl?
1992	‘Poor !’ said the nurse, hurriedly putting a green glass bottle back in the pocket of her long skirt.
1992	‘I see you're staring at the handkerchieves, my .
1992	‘Don't worry, my ,’ Fagin said, putting down the knife and becoming once again the kind old gentleman.
1992	‘I only tried to frighten you, my .
1992	‘Take my advice, my ,’ he said.
1992	Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my ?’
1992	‘You're a clever boy, my ,’ said the old gentleman, putting his hand on Oliver's head.
1992	‘Hush — be quiet, my , or you'll be ill again.
1992	‘I don't know, my .
1992	‘And I'm afraid,’ added Fagin, ignoring Sikes' remark, ‘that if we're in trouble, then a lot of other people will be in trouble too, if you understand me, my .’
1992	‘Nancy, my ,’ Fagin said.
1992	‘My child, don't be afraid,’ said Mr Brownlow kindly.
1992	‘Oh, my brother!’
1992	Make him come home,’ the young woman said to the crowd, ‘or he'll kill his mother and father, and break my heart.’
1992	‘Delighted to see you looking so well, my ,’ Fagin said, bowing politely.
1992	‘So you wanted to get away, my , did you?
1992	‘And where do you think the boy is now, my ?’
1992	‘On your business, my ,’ said Fagin, glancing at him uneasily.
1992	Oh, Dr Losberne, and my aunt, I beg you both to have pity on him.’
1992	‘Yes, my ,’ he heard Fagin say, ‘you're right.
1992	‘Tell me one thing, Rose.
1992	‘Don't be bad-tempered, my ,’ said Fagin calmly.
1992	‘I haven't a single coin with me, my ,’ said Fagin.
1992	When they were inside, Fagin told the girl, ‘I'll just go upstairs and fetch the cash for Bill, my .
1992	‘This will surprise you very much, but you were once very kind to a friend of mine, and I'm sure you will be interested to hear news of him.’
1992	‘God!’ she said.
1992	‘My old nurse!’ cried Oliver.
1992	‘If you drink that every day, my , you'll need to empty pockets, houses, coaches, even banks.’
1992	‘It doesn't matter who did it, my ,’ replied Fagin, looking quickly at Charlotte.
1992	‘Exactly so, my .

1992	All languages have modes of address which can be used to express familiarity or deference in a similar way, cf. the difference between you, mate, , darling, and Mr Smith, Sir, Professor Brown, Mrs Jones, Madam.

1993	‘There are lots of things Stephen will never tell you, my .
1993	‘Glad to see you're able to forget all your duties and enjoy yourself, ,’ she said.
1993	‘And you, my , are every bit as attractive as Stephen described.’
1993	You see, revenge, Christina, is the sweetest taste of all.’
1993	‘What's the matter, my ?’ he said.
1993	‘I hope that my brother will soon be better,’ I replied with a smile.
1993	‘It's the funeral of my friend, Lauengram,’ he said, in answer to our question.
1993	‘friend!’ he said.
1993	‘My friend,’ he cried.
1993	‘Try to be quick, ,’ said his wife.
1993	‘We're going to live in the country, in a little white house near a railway line.
1993	‘Wake up, ,’ she said.
1993	Mr (we do not know your name),

1993	Sir and Ladies — We would like to say thank you for saving the train and stopping a very bad accident.

1993	‘Take care of your mother, my .
1993	I haven't done much yet, but I have hopes, my — I have hopes.’
1993	My colleagues at work sent a message, saying: ‘John, on your second birthday in captivity your good friends at WTN send their love.
1993	I mean what else can they do, ?’
1993	Old Thing,
1993	She deserved no less, for she was the kindest, sweetest, friend he had in the world.
1993	Harry,
1993	‘My girl,’ he said, his voice husky with longing, ‘we've got to stop this.
1993	‘I am not a romantic, my Jules.’

1993	So put it on, my .
1993	‘She's still very young, ,’ Eloise said.
1993	He…he only sees me as a…a friend.
1993	‘Harry's an old and friend.
1993	‘Enjoy yourselves, my ,’ she said as they prepared to leave.
1993	‘My girl, you'd have thought him very ill-bred if he'd talked about money to you, and even if he had, you wouldn't have understood the relevance of what he was saying, any more than he understands how well off we are.
1993	‘Honestly, , I'm not in the least frightened,’ she said.
1993	You've been a wonderful sister to me, .
1993	‘I know, .
1993	Oh, Dorothy, my , how shall I tell you?
1993	‘You have made me so happy, .

1986	much larger, and with varied heads,
1991	‘Oh ,’ murmured Julia, looking down at her baggy tweed coat and skimpy straight skirt.
1991	‘I think it's just a bad cold, my ; but in this climate and with all the infections flying about, I'll keep a close watch on you,’ he said calmly.
1991	‘David,’ she said, ‘my , David.’
1991	‘But, David,’ she said pitifully, ‘you can't want us interfering at such a moment.
1991	‘Yes, my , love, it is,’ he said with a tiny smile on his lips.
1992	—Oh .
1992	I'm a free man, and all that you hold , you rich men — and beggars too — none of it has any power over me.’
1992	But no, father.

0000	But while her novels of this period —The Languages of Love (1957),The Sycamore Tree ,(1958),The Deceit ,(1960), and The Middlemen (1961)— are in many respects typical products of their generation, they raise a number of issues which it was not possible to articulate within the parameters of the contemporary debate.
0000	It is indicative of the pressure to conform to gender-coded standards that The Deceit , the most serious and most personal of her first four novels, has as its protagonist a lone male suffering from an identity crisis over his patronym.
0000	The Deceit represents a questioning of the causal logic of narrative and the literary heritage which provided both her and her readers with a whole set of ready-made narrative assumptions.
0000	1.3 The Deceit: Truth and Narrative.
0000	In The Deceit (1960) the dichotomy between truth and fiction hinted at in The Sycamore Tree is brought to the fore, and the possibility of reaching a pre-discursive reality is relinquished once and for all.
0000	In many respects The Deceit is a summing up of Brooke-Rose's first two novels.
0000	But narration is seen in The Deceit as the original and persistent obstacle to ‘truth’ because the process of constructing a story inevitably leads to falsification.
0000	This is both the ‘deceit’ which goes back centuries and the curse peculiar to modern-day society.
0000	The Deceit explores the consequences of our immersion in this type of fictional convention.
0000	In the 1960s and 1970s Brooke-Rose rediscovered the recycling of our cultural heritage condemned in The Deceit as a form of parodic interrogation.
0000	Though the technique employed in The Deceit represents a laying-bare of traditional narrative devices without offering an alternative approach, it sets the stage for the more radical break with the conventions of realism which Brooke-Rose's fiction demonstrated four years later.
0000	The Languages of Love ,The Sycamore Tree , and The Deceit all portray characters who are defined by their roles as interpreters or carriers of information.
0000	In The Deceit mis-quotation generates an ironic effect of mis-contextualization.

1986	And indeed when she reached the parish church she received a moment of instant gratification at the sight of her friend Lizzie Braithwaite looking far from her best in a regal but positively strident magenta.
1986	But then, Lizzie, for all the money — and it was reputed to be in millions — that her late husband had left her, had never known how to dress; nor did any of the tribe of Braithwaites sitting around her, who had clearly chosen whatever had turned out to be the most expensive and put it on their large, angular bodies just anyhow.
1986	Yet Amabel said a very pleasant good morning to his mother, her friend Maria, who had been most gratifyingly keen to marry this ecclesiastical son of hers to Gemma.
1986	Particularly those , good people at the back who, although asked to attend the service, could not be invited to the reception.
1986	Surely Aunt Amabel must agree with that?
1986	Oh .
1986	"father, thank you so much," her smile said — for he had loved and cherished her most tenderly, claiming her obedience as his right, his due.
1986	"My young lady, why so bitter?
1986	"Oh yes — my — I have.
1986	"My , it is God's will," Amabel kept on saying because that was the thing her own mother and her old nanny — both gone now — had always said to her.
1986	"Oh, a little pale perhaps," murmured Amabel, because paleness seemed essential to the occasion, although with nut-brown Gemma it was rather hard to tell.
1986	But John-William had bought so much land at Far Flatley from Colonel Covington-Pym, a whole bank of his river and several fields beyond that there would have been ample room to build Gemma and Tristan a little nest.
1986	And the , good man had designed Almsmead, in the centre of a green field; had surrounded it with a rose-garden; given her apple trees and a lily-pond; a trellised, covered walk down to the river with its clear, clean water in which she could see smooth pebbles and little silvery fishes instead of the slime and gas bubbles and dead cats one saw — if one had the stomach to look — in Frizingley's canal.
1986	And when her maids had got her dressed and done her hair and she had breakfasted by her tall windows overlooking her manicured rose-garden and a green, daisy-starred meadow, she had nothing to alarm her throughout the day but the possibility of a visit from the formidable Mrs Covington-Pym or the awkwardness, as she took her carriage-exercise, of encountering the wife of her friend Mr Adolphus Moon who had made himself so very agreeable.
1986	John-William insisting on having everything just so, Amabel herself taking time and immense delight in her choice of furnishings, living a dozen delightful dramas every day over Aubusson rugs and inlaid cabinets, the recklessness of silk damask on newly plastered walls, the sheer extravagances of crystal and china which Linnet — the child — had encouraged her to commit.
1986	"Oh yes, ."
1986	"Gemma , he has a right to be considered and I believe he is a fresh-air man — the Gages and the Bartram-Hyndes have all been brought up to that.
1986	"Gemma my love — oh — how can I say this without giving offence?
1986	Yet Gemma had shown no more than a polite interest in Almsmead while Linnet, who was very but not Gemma, after all, had positively thrown herself into all the excitements of housebuilding and furnishing, taking to Far Flatley as if she had been born there.
1986	Linnet.
1986	And then we'll just run across the street to Miss Baker's and order some more, so that the old thing will not feel left out.
1986	They went, wreathed in love and kisses for their Gemma yet tiptoeing slightly as people do when making an escape.
1986	"You will find" all that "very wearisome, my ," Amabel had murmured, blushing like a girl, on her return from honeymoon.
1986	And when you have a little baby to show for it then I expect you will think it worthwhile."

1989	He was a old gentleman who was very kind to me.
1993	However, as her wish was for Polly to follow her two sisters' example and ‘settle down’, that was not surprising.
1993	‘Nathan, my friend, how are you?’ he gushed.
1993	Oh, .’
0000	Sir,
0000	But the answer to Mr. Daniel's point is .
0000	My Lancey,
0000	(No. 2)[1990]2 Lloyds Rep. 526 Hirst l-held that it was a benefit or an avoidance of a disbenefit to the defendants that the plaintiffs agreed to take delivery of a ship on the contract date since—
0000	Jorden v. Money can be distinguished, because there the promisor made it that she did not intend to be legally bound, whereas in the cases to which I refer the proper inference was that the promisor did intend to be bound.
1989	‘An angel passing, my ?’
1989	‘You are cold, my ?
1989	‘All right, my ,’ he murmured, ‘we'll have you right as rain in a moment.
1989	In the hope that it might cheer his wife Frere had brought a letter from her friend in Cambridge, who was, of course, as yet unaware of Emilia's condition.
1989	‘Of course, my , it is not entirely true.
1989	‘Indeed we do, my .’
1989	‘My .’
1989	‘My , since we first came to this terrible place you are the only person to show me true consideration.’
1989	My , he is distraught with anxiety for you.’
1989	‘Oh my .’
1989	‘I think, my , you have not yet learned what a curse it is to be born woman.
1989	I'd swing for you, my .
1989	‘Here's to a successful firing, my .’
1989	as if it was the most natural thing in the world he said, ‘God bless you, my , I knew all along it would be all right.
1989	‘You're quite right, my .
1989	She wanted to press her hand on his, say, ‘My , Mr Frere, I beg you to forgive what must appear an intolerable intrusion, but I have reason to believe your present happiness must be short-lived unless…’
1989	‘Emilia, , do you imagine I could abandon you now at the very moment I have longed for?
1989	‘My ,’ she said, ‘you look a little wan this morning.
1989	‘My ?’
1989	My , one had positively risked an influenza to bring her some good cheer, and to what end?
1989	‘My , the woman no longer does even that.
1989	He wanted me out, my .
1989	Otherwise, my fellow, you will soon be of no use to wife, man nor beast.
1989	‘My ?’
1989	‘God, Emilia, there is no pleasing you and your family.
1989	God, what had he done that things should come to such a pass as this?
1989	‘My ,’ he attempted, ‘how good to see you up and about again.’
1989	God, he was beginning to think he would be glad of it.
1993	‘Taheb, my , I have a gatekeeper , and this house is within the palace compound.
1991	‘If you like, .’
1991	‘Like some tomato sauce, ?’
1991	She dropped the , she had made a mistake there, he was not the sort you called .
1991	‘Bring me a cup of tea, ,’ said Coffin to the waitress as she passed, absently reproducing her own tones.
1982	‘Couldn't say, boy, but we do encourage young officers to think creatively.’
1982	‘Oh ,’ Agnes said brightly.
1982	I imagine you've noticed that our prime Minister doesn't exactly go a bundle on us, on any of us?’
1982	She had replied that it still seemed an expensive policy compared with even the of umbrellas, and George had thought about that and said: ‘You can't piss into an umbrella, either.
1982	How is Ronald?’
1982	‘me.
1982	She lived day to day, as Mina always had — or rather, year to year, on a British Certificate of Identity renewed annually.
1992	How Maisie, or Natalia, and certainly Emma, would laugh to see him enslaved by an ankle after their more generous gifts of person yet enslaved he was.
1992	‘My Gwendolen,’ he cut in impatiently, disengaging her from his new blazer.
1992	‘My Gwendolen,’ he solicitously and hypocritically began, ‘I fear this fellow has upset you.’
1992	‘My sir.’
1992	‘My Gwendolen.’
1992	She'd be expecting a full report on Pierremont House and the little village, so quiet, so tasteful.
1992	‘No, my lady, I regret I have not.
1992	‘Bill, Bill, you cannot have the heart to kill me.’’
1992	‘Edith, will you forgive me?
1992	‘My ,’ he said at last to Edith, ‘do you think you might enjoy the rat of your holiday at Broadstairs?’
1992	‘Forgive me, lady, but that did not appear to be the case last night.’
1992	‘Thomas and I were on the point of announcing our engagement.
1992	‘Never would I have voted against Thomas.
1992	‘Mudfog, Our Town, Cloisterham — in other words, , Rochester,’ announced Gwendolen, alighting enthusiastically from the London, Chatham and Dover Railway and waving her pink umbrella vigorously.
1992	‘For you, Angelina.
1992	‘Oh come, my lady, he died a natural death.’
1992	‘You tell me, my .’
1992	‘No, my young man,’ she smiled, assuming she had won her point, ‘if you seek a villain, look no further!’
1992	‘No, no, the sun will hurt your complexion, madam.
1991	‘Hello, me ,’ he said affably.
1991	‘Pour out, my , would you?’
1992	‘God, do you think I didn't?’
1992	Will you take my place in the family, my ?
1992	It was my friend Henry Clerval.
1992	‘My Victor!’ he said.
1992	Suddenly he said: ‘My Victor, what is the matter with you?
1992	My Victor, I want you to know before you arrive home that an awful thing has happened.
1992	Your youngest  brother, William, is dead.
1992	Hurry home, my Victor.
1992	And she was almost looking forward to death, because then she would be with William and our mother in a place of peace.
1992	My friend!’
1992	My Victor, I am so happy to know that you will soon be home.
1992	I returned to our room and lay on the bed next to my wife.
1992	So the evil monster had brought unhappiness and death to a old man who had never hurt anybody.
1992	‘, oh, ,’ he drawled with mocking disdain, ‘what am I thinking?
1992	‘, , your highness,’ he drawled with no attempt to hide the sarcasm in his voice, ‘did I hit a soft spot?’
1992	‘He's not a carpenter, , he's an architect, and a highly respected one at that.
1992	I don't suppose you've got eyes for anyone but old Jonathan.’
1992	‘Your perceptions are leading you astray, sister, ,’ Dana mocked.
1992	‘How does a honeymoon strike you, sister, ?’
1992	‘Quite right, my Claudia.’
1992	Myra is a , but she's also a gossip…my reputation will be in shreds by the time I get back.’
1992	‘Oh, , what a shame when they were only trying to show their appreciation.’
1992	No, my Claudia, I haven't made a mistake; the mistake is Garry's; whoever his new woman is, she can't be as lovely as you are.’
1992	‘That scarf thing does nothing for you, sister, ,’ she said mockingly.
1992	You should try it sometimes, sister, , instead of the boring brown-mouse colour you cling to.’
1992	He gave it me to spend, presumably so he could spend time making love to you, sister, ,’ Dana said when Claudia asked her that question after Roman had gone to his room.
1992	‘You could be right, sister , but a man in his position needs a wife, and I would fit in with him in every way.
1992	‘That's as maybe; we're not a bit alike, sister , so your theory falls flat.
1973	Briefly, I need to ask you, my Miss Rossignol, if you have had any word within the last year from your great-uncle, Doctor Alan Morris.’
1973	‘You have a very positive standing, my young lady,’ said Mr Stanforth patiently, and perhaps a little patronisingly, too, for this was where money entered into the reckoning, and very young concert artists and music teachers with a living to make must surely react to the alluring image.
1973	‘Oh, !’ said Charlotte, groping in the depths of her  handbag, ‘I seem to have left my lighter in the dining-room.
1973	‘Will you let him in, ?’
1973	‘My girl, are you sure you're not recalling rather more than happened?
1973	‘My , this is frivolous,’ her husband said with frowning disapproval.
1989	And on would come old Bill, or whoever was stuck in the Met.
1989	And so my , sister died.’
1989	‘I have been very lonely without my sister, but a month ago a friend asked me to marry him.
1989	‘My Holmes!
1989	‘Oh .
1989	‘Well, tonight, my Watson, I need your help.
1989	My Mr Sherlock Holmes,
1989	How can I thank you, Mr Holmes?’
1982	To make this little fellow
1992	‘Well, I expect he was annoyed, ,’ she said judiciously.
1992	It was rather your own fault, Folly, .
1992	‘Well, that was good, .
1992	‘I suppose so, .’
1992	‘Of course you do, ,’ her mother said patiently.
1992	‘My , since you will be taking over next week, I think it is about time I explained our system for dealing with our more special customers.
1992	‘A very good question, my .
1992	‘Luke,’ she said fondly, and, still standing on the doorstep, plucked at the card.
1990	‘me, Mr Barnett, do you not know?’
1990	Well, Rex was either lying or labouring under a misapprehension.
1992	My child, Richard Talbot would never have left his widow alone.
1992	My , it is a great treat for me to have a girl in the house.
1992	‘That's travelling, my .
1992	She paused and then said, ‘Don't pull a face, my .’
1992	Aunt Emily said, ‘You are a child.
1992	Aunt Emily said, There is no need to be so stiff, my .’
1992	‘Daffodils already my !
1992	‘My , don't get up.
1992	‘Who, my ?
1992	Should you really, my ?
1992	No don't get up, my , I'm thoroughly toasted now, warm as a new loaf —’
1992	‘I wish you would not walk, my .
1992	Do mind the baby, children, oh , he always wants to join in and he invariably gets trodden underfoot —’
1992	‘Shall you, my , I'm sure I don't like to leave you all on your own, not at first—’
1992	‘You are a miracle, my ,’ Mrs Chamberlin said.
1992	Miss Abbott, how do I possibly reward you?’
1992	‘My , the very thing!
1992	‘Roughly two hens a person, my .
1992	My , I don't in the least want to hurry you but I think you should go.
1992	‘Hens, my ?’
1992	Alexandra, I think things are just beginning!’
1992	‘My child!’
1992	Aunt Emily said from the doorway in much the same tone, ‘My Alexandra!
1992	‘It is my pleasure, child.
1992	My , you look tired.
1992	Aunt Emily said with real warmth, ‘I am so glad, my .
1992	, .
1992	‘Ah, my ,’ he said with great gentleness.
1992	She keeps giving me clothes —; not this old awful thing, Mrs McPhee at home made this — and making me practise manners and the piano and I couldn't tell her about last night, I couldn't, I can't disappoint another person, not after my mother —’ and Alexandra put her head down on to the slice of bread on her plate and burst into tears.
1992	‘Eat that, my .’
1992	‘You see, my , you don't really need advice at all.
1992	Aunt Emily said, ‘If you read it, child, it will take away your fear,’ and Alexandra, stubbornly remembering Michael Swinton's saying that she seemed to be working out her own salvation and feeling that the decision to read the journal must be part of that working out, shook her head and sent her needle stabbing in and out of the canvas.
1992	I wish it was yesterday, I wish I was just climbing over the rocks in comfortable Mrs McPhee who doesn't mind getting wet and lets me breathe —’
1992	She said, ‘Why George, my , I think — I am sure Miss Abbott — but of course only too delighted —’
1992	‘My !’
1992	Now, my , I don't know about saying shocking things — and I must confess, although the Rector would be horrified to hear me say it, that I should be very tempted to say shocking things at Langley Dene, such very new money my , everything so dreadfully bright and shiny — as I was saying, I don't know about saying shocking things, but you are certainly doing them.
1992	Rumour says, my , that you actually took tea with Mr Swinton!’
1992	‘My , do put him down.
1992	You mustn't let yourself be exploited though he is a , aren't you, Jack?
1992	My , Meg works as a cleaning woman for Mr Swinton.
1992	‘My , I never meant to offend you.
1992	‘My !’
1992	‘My !
1992	‘Listen, my ,’ she said to Alexandra, summoned  flushed and impatient from the orchard where she had been settling her new charges in and attempting, as tactfully as possible, to exclude Murphy from the process, ‘Mrs Langley says George is heartened beyond anything by your visit.
1992	‘Aunt Emily, please may I go?
1992	‘Well, my ?’
1992	Come and pour out for us, my .
1992	‘My , please —’
1992	Then he turned and said simply to Alexandra, ‘My , thank you,’ and was gone.
1992	‘But why, my ?
1992	‘Aunt Emily.
1992	Michael Swinton looked easily at both of them and said to Alexandra, ‘My , you really are holding court.’
1992	‘My child, there is no question of it.
1992	‘Mr Swinton,’ she wrote
1992	Aunt Emily said, ‘Look, my .’
1992	‘Yes, my .
1992	‘There, my ,’ Aunt Emily said and glanced at the little drawing by her bed.
1992	‘Are you not delighted, my ?
1992	They will be clamouring for him now, my , simply clamouring.’
1992	‘My Alexandra’
1992	Don't my .
1992	‘I didn't mean to trouble you, Aunt Emily.
1992	‘I did, my , I did.
1992	The doctor, on his now daily visit, said simply to Alexandra, ‘A matter of time, my , a matter of time.’
1992	‘My Alexandra —;
1992	He had turned back to help someone else out of the train, but at the sound of her calling, he swung round and stood waiting, his arms outstretched and his face, above that and familiar gingery beard, creased with the broadest smile.
1992	‘My , you have the best heart!
1992	You see, my , we had a little difficulty over which should adorn the top of the tree, the star of  Bethlehem which is of course the only proper thing as well as being the only thing countenanced by the Rector, or an immensely glittering and unsuitable fairy doll someone was so ill-judged as to give to Helen.
1992	So you see, my , you are a pleasure in more ways than you know!’
1992	‘My , we cannot ask her, we simply cannot, such finery —’
1992	‘Cross purposes, my !
1992	I misinterpreted you, my .
1982	Oh me, no, young lady.
1982	But you know, boy, the only possible reason  for taking a job like this is to get away from school or family.’
1982	There are parts of my life, my Malcolm, that even you are not privy to.
1982	Oh — a melancholy thought.
1982	Oh God, Superintendent: don't tell me it was the sherry.’
1982	‘My Mr Martins, I beg you to reconsider, to make no hasty decision,’ came the headmaster's voice, raised to a sort of wail that was anything but confidence-creating.
1982	Oh , I wonder what Tom told them.’
1993	‘Oh ,’ I mocked.
1993	‘Most ingenious, my Daunbey.
1993	Don't play games with me, monk.
1993	‘Above all, what will my uncle think if we now return, empty-handed, to report the deaths of Cosmas and Damien?
1993	‘So what does all this make you, Mathilda, my ?
1993	‘To be perfectly honest, my Roger, I don't really know.
1993	‘Do so and Uncle will simply laugh and put it down to my youthful impetuosity.
1984	‘So did I, boy, so did I,’ said the star lugubriously, and got a good laugh from the cast.
1984	Oh .
1984	‘That generation, ?
1984	‘No publicity, …’
1984	Oh .
1984	Charles,
1984	‘Poor, Micky…
1984	Oh .
1993	My girl, it's a small fortune!
1993	‘Oh, .
1993	‘Oh, heaven!’ she whispered.
1993	‘heaven!
1993	‘God!’ he breathed.
1993	‘Oh, heaven!
1993	‘Oh, !’ he exclaimed, not sounding sorry at all.
1993	‘God!’ he muttered, his fingers fumbling.
1993	‘…my brother Rizzi and his engagement to Contessa Katarina Vivarini…’
1992	, precious Emily.
1992	‘Don't worry, my Lisa.
1992	But I think, my Lisa, if you cast your mind back you'll recall that you made the assumption all by yourself.
1992	‘Is that a threat, my Lisa?
1992	I assure you, my Lisa, I have an excellent memory.’
1992	Why else, my Lisa?
1992	‘And this time, my Lisa, make sure they're suitable.’
1992	From your Nina.’
1992	Whoever his Nina was, she must have had a hard time of it!
1992	But, in spite of the genuine excitement that possessed her, she could not quite banish from her mind a picture of that greetings card, signed ‘From your Nina’, that stood propped in one corner of Vass's desk.
1992	Maybe, after all, his ‘Nina’ did not have such a singular place in his life.
1992	His ‘Nina’.
1992	, sweet Emily.
1992	‘Surely, my Lisa, you cannot doubt it?’
1992	Nina, my Lisa, as you ought to have guessed…is not my girlfriend.
1992	‘My Maude…’
1992	‘But, my Ranulf, that too causes a problem.
1992	‘My de Craon, my troops are all over it.’
1979	‘Naturally, Mother ,’ said Margaret sweetly.
1979	Bill Clough was a small grocer, with a nice little shop in a working-class area, where he had managed to survive the competition from the big chains by being convenient, not  outrageously , and usually cheerful.
1979	Without waiting for a reply, she put her head into the room and said in that all-things-bright-and-beautiful voice she reserved for her mother-in-law, which Greg found grating even on first acquaintance: ‘I've got a lovely surprise for you, Mother .
1979	Two days later Greg was forced to attend the funeral of a aunt.
1979	The first of those from Viola was addressed in fact to ‘Walter and Hilda’, but it was not difficult to guess that it was intended primarily for Walter's eyes.
1979	Hilda,
1979	Or perhaps the two old together.
1979	‘Once more into the breach, friends.’
1986	Tell you what, you folks.
1986	‘Tom, , by the time I've asked you to pass something, and you've said what and where is it and didn't I mean the other one, I can get this oven done and the baby born I should think.’
1986	‘Well, no , I don't think I would mistake you for a stook of corn.
1986	‘I wouldn't have thought you'd want to go all down there again, , haven't you had enough walking for one day?
1986	‘Never mind, Tiddy , was you fwighted den?’ she said to the dog.
1986	Dr Jane, Tuesday.
1986	Dr Miller, Wednesday.
1986	I still think of him, though I lost him before we was fifty — that's more than thirty years ago now .
1986	Another said mournfully, ‘Don't you let them impose on you, .
1993	‘Oh …’
1993	Oh, !
1993	Frankly, if I weren't in such a high-risk position, I'd want someone a little more cosy as my obstetrician, but Owen is the best for someone like me and at times he can be a , so I shouldn't complain…
1993	‘Oh, , how terrible!
1993	‘My girl, he's one of the best architects in Brisbane, and he hasn't reached the top yet.
1993	‘Sit up slowly, ,’ Sister Farrer was saying, and Belinda obeyed.
1993	‘It was Faye, , silly Faye, with her ridiculous attempt to doll you up into the sort of woman she thought I'd want.
1993	God, why should she still find him so disturbing after all he had done to her?
1993	God, was this anticipation or apprehension, and why should she feel either?
1991	My Mrs Goreng, I felt like saying, you would have been surprised to come across a hotelier who'd read Thomas Mann.
1991	The queen in me, would have been poor, , dead Maria's acerbic comment.
1991	‘And you must be patient a little longer, my Adolph.
1991	Adolph,
1991	Without the Colonel I might never have got through; they preferred you to leave someone behind.
1986	and utters German baby words to the Princess,
1986	— Stockmar!
1989	‘God!’ cried Mrs Wood, ‘an old devil sitting by the fire!
1989	‘My Dawkins,’ he said, ‘You will think this is very strange.
1989	It's a joke, my Teesdale.
1989	‘God,’ he prayed, ‘keep us safe this night.’
1989	Then with luck I'll see my wife before midnight.’
1989	‘Oh .
1989	I thought about my wife, and for a short time I felt better.
1989	‘You fell, ,’ she said.
1989	So of course he called me, my .
1989	God!
1989	‘Anyway, ,’ said his wife, ‘you're so busy, with the house and the garden and the farm.
1991	The reason he asked me out, Leo, was because he had overheard some of the girls from the agency talking about the money Aunt Jane left me — wasn't it wonderful?
1991	‘God, Hilary,’ he gasped on a swiftly indrawn breath, ‘don't do that.’
1991	Neither, hopefully, will my brother.
1991	‘Oh, God,’ she whispered.
1991	God, but he'd been angry.
1991	‘Verlander, my Hilary.
1991	‘Because, my Hilary, he owes me some money.’
1991	‘My girl, you could never in your life look like an old hag, and you seem to forget that so far I've never seen you at your best.
1991	‘God, how I love you!’
1990	I mean, ‘Cripes, , if it was anonymity you'd wanted you should have gone into the family tailoring  business,’ I hear you say, with some justification.
1990	Oh , oh , oh .’
1990	Frankly, my , I didn't give a damn!
1990	This was less to do with Olivier's plunging rousingly into ‘Once more into the breach, friends’ than with his own attempts to plunge ‘Once more into the bra straps, friend’.
1990	Ricci, that's bleeding horses — I've never even seen a horse, , except with a policeman underneath or on My Friend Flicka, and I don't care WHAT they wear at the wretched Olympics.’
1990	‘Now look, as my secretary has told you just the six times, I am totally booked for 1990 and I can't possibly…oh …
1990	The reply comes zooming down the phone: ‘Of course, , we'll understand — don't think another thought about it — we're just looking forward to seeing you, and we'll be in touch nearer the time, …’
1990	Once in the marquee I spotted good old Barry Norman, Michael Denison and others.
1990	First of all, my man friend died of cancer, aged forty-two.
1990	On two occasions we were called into the hospital in the wee small hours, expecting the end — but the old rogue had nine lives and, at seventy-nine, he seemed to be negotiating for another two.
1990	It read: ‘Moishe, Your teeth are at Maureen's.
1990	‘Hello, operator, I'm trying to get through to the Kosher butcher — it's on the blink and I've people coming for dinner Friday — Oh, thank you, .
1990	Yes! fine thank you, , and yours?
1990	I collected more useful bits of linking dialogue from Reggie, from Ma and Pa and from her brother Tommy and her friend Virginia Graham.
1990	One evening he turned a small chair over on its side and said ‘While I'm gone, Geraldine, , could you work on turning this chair into a forest?’
1990	‘Imagine you're squeezing a penny between your cheeks, ,’ he would burr in his soft Scots voice, and I can assure you he wasn't referring to the cheeks of my face.
1990	‘Sorry ,’ I concluded, ‘but Piaf she 'ain't.’
1990	On our way home via New York, some ‘’ friends (as in generous), fixed us a stretch limo to take us to the airport.
1993	All the time the water like progress under the prow.
1993	Ever since coming upon Rousseau's writings so long ago, I have tried to live with my wife above the glaciers in the condition he would have approved, that of the Noble Savage — in defiance of those citified creatures who multiply in the valleys far below.
1993	That silver dish in the sky is like an eye, guarding me.
1993	Harold.
1993	Harold.
1993	‘I hope you don't mind, Harold .’
1993	‘But are you all right, my , after your long journey?
1993	‘Let's have our tea, ,’ he said, with a show of patience.
1993	‘Let's go to bed, my ,’ Alice said.
1993	‘OK, , fine, great, now, if you don't mind, I want to pop into Felicity's room and just say goodnight to her.
1993	‘No, , it's OK,’ he said, reassuringly, although he never used the word ‘OK’.
1993	‘Now, Alice, , don't get worked up, it's just a little hospitality.
1993	‘Don't come out, , you'll catch your death of cold.
1993	‘Worship, Alice, do de female stuff, !
1991	My Theo,
1991	Charles joins me in wishing you a perfect holiday, Theo,
1991	people.
1991	Can I come in, ?’
1991	‘It's me, .
1991	‘I don't suppose Hereward dug the pit specially to catch you in, ,’ said Deaconess Tilley.
1991	‘All right for food are you, , or shall I pop round the shop for you?’
1991	‘Well, I'll have to love you and leave you now, .’
1991	‘Oh ’, said Theodora, as she gazed after the familiar vehicle.
1991	‘My girl!
1991	‘My girl, it would be so kind of you, but I hardly like to trouble you.’
1991	The Archdeacon had said, ‘Oh ’ a number of times and driven off, refusing Miss Tilley's offer of a bite of hot-pot.
1991	‘Theo, my girl, your country sojourn has made you hoydenish.
1991	‘My , such a time.’
1991	‘Your father.’
1991	‘My , I've known Gilbert Racy for thirty years.
1991	She was desperately lonely, poor .’
1983	‘My chap, right on time!
1983	Please see to it, my — before they go beyond your power, perhaps?’
1982	‘It's not your day, is it, ?’
1982	It gave her a comfortable glow to think of the church and the life that went on around it, and familiar and with the same basic pattern everywhere.
1982	Oh ,’ Sophia looked depressed, ‘perhaps it isn't so splendid after all.
1982	‘You've met her, ,’ said Sophia.
1982	Ah, my ,’ she said, seeing Sophia at the front door, ‘Here we are, you see, safe and sound.’
1982	‘Yes, my .
1982	‘Oh ,’ said Ianthe.
1982	‘Oh no, ,’ Miss Grimes laughed.
1982	‘So I can see, .
1982	‘Oh, it is good of you, , it really is.’
1982	‘Ah, my ,’ said the languid voice.
1982	‘My , this is a fashionable London parish, so called,’ said Randolph.
1982	‘No, , you must be mistaken,’ said Bertha in a pained tone.
1982	‘Let me give you some more mutton, my .’
1982	‘You aren't a great meat-eater, are you, ,’ said Bertha, ‘so the approach of Lent won't be so much of a hardship for you.’
1982	‘Oh ,’ Ianthe heard herself saying, feebly, she felt, but it was difficult to know how best to express her sympathy.
1982	‘My , you look wretched,’ she said.
1982	And how are you, my ?’
1982	‘Oh ,’ Penelope murmured.
1982	Look, ,’ she opened her capacious shopping bag and invited Sophia to peer into its depths.
1993	God!
1993	heavens!
1993	‘Oh, lord, what's happened to my vocal cords?’
1993	Oh, God, the chairman himself!
1993	God — not the same scenario of shame and perversion!
1993	Oh, God!
1993	Oh, God, this was more than she could bear!
1993	Oh, God — don't say it's anything to do with Svend and Suzie!’
1993	Oh, lord, how she wished she were.
1993	‘Oh, , and I was thinking you'd brought them specially for me.
1993	‘Oh, ,’ Luke grinned.
1993	‘The man knows that I collect swans,’ she explained to Merrill and Richard, ‘and he left it on the hall table with my name on a label around its neck.
1993	‘Then break it, my ,’ he said sweepingly as they reached Luke's car.
1993	lord, what was she doing?
1993	‘Well, in this day and age that approach does at least have the benefit of novelty, I'll grant you that, Shannon, my .’
1993	‘My Shannon, for someone so pitifully characterless, you really have had the most fascinating life.’
1993	And what's it like knowing your daddy died in a shoot-out?
1992	A business letter, for example, will usually contain your address, the recipients address, the date, sir, yours faithfully and possible the words ‘with reference to …

1992	Will and Deirdre came to supper recently — poor it was an uninspired meal but their visit cheered me immeasurably…
1992	Did not get the  job — , former [xx]Manager, drove me up there (6 miles north of Perth) and then on to Dunkeld where he insisted on giving me lunch — he had originally thought of taking me to Gleneagles, but I had to get back to the outplacement people — and did so, only to find ‘my’ counsellor had, for the third time, failed to keep an appointment with me.
1992	I have to decide whether to put in my poems and short stories and a series of LETTERS, originally called LETTERS TO x (some 180 very short letters written in three days in  about two years ago) rather in the writing style of the legendary ABBIE written in the 1920s (or 30s? you are bound to know!) by Dane Chandos.
1993	‘Which book is it, ?’
1993	‘Come on !
1993	‘Up and at ‘em, !’
1993	‘You can't just have that for breakfast, .’
1993	‘Sit your self down and have a nice cup of tea, .’
1988	What's that, my ?
1988	’ That would be very nice, my .’
1988	’ Oh, , Mr. Kopek,’she said, immediately realising my predicament.
1988	He insisted on trying to go it alone and lurched against the bannister where he hung on for life.
1988	Oh , I thought, feeling very sorry for myself, and I'm not even a drinking man.
1990	‘You are all right, are you, ?
1987	Training was very very today, I dunno what it is now  it was very very to train 'em.
1986	oh
1986	no tail  oh oh but you see then of course and I was still not married but you see I, as I say, then I went to Cambridge and that's when I met my husband and all his family were so kind to me, er he had erm two sisters living in a flat round the backs, you've heard of round the backs
1986	Er and she said I'll ring you ag I said oh someone now coming to the door, she said, never mind I'll ring you on Saturday, so I said alright and er and she lives at Wyndham, Norfolk, my husband's niece and erm, you see, and then there's the other one and she said, auntie you're always so cheerful , I said, well I try to be cheerful because like everybody else I get a little depressed sometimes because, you see, I have no sisters and brothers, I have three elderly cousins who live away and who I, who I see, one was here a fortnight ago  er er er my cousin and his wife er, you see, it will be on a Wednesday, a fortnight today, no Thursday, yes, you see, a fortnight ago and they said, we'll come again an we've always bought you a bunch of daffodils so we shall come again when the daffodils are  and er and they bring me over bits and pieces because er she was a cook and they bring me something nice to eat
1986	he was so nice
1986	Oh
1987	Oh I suppose seventy odd a day.
1989	Oh .
1989	Oh
1993	I mean now, the erm  the social workers erm are care managers in a lot of cases, in other words it may be contracted out to somebody else to do the actual caring and you look at the package which the client is getting,you know it might be I dunno some old who needs  meals on wheels and visits every  week or something
1991	Oh, , I'm sorry about this.
1991	So you're expected to give your sweets to your older brother, oh .
1991	In previous years I haven't had a class on the  and I thought I had one this year as an experiment  and er, pardon me just a second   hello  yes, that was a little annoying to say the least, cos those students have come in specially for that, yeah,yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  right  Oh right  certainly not  well, would it be easier to show them in my office, that's seven, seven, seven?
1993	Have a nice day at the office, .
1984	Oh yes they've built oh , they've built houses and houses I don't know Rhos-y-Bol today.
1984	Oh it was worse than I c anything I can think of.
1984	He was a father and he had two sons, doctors.
1988	But the following Thursday Mrs  said, Well I'm very sorry my , I can't accept your butter because last week's lot didn't keep.
1988	Th they they demanded a higher wage er for erm just because Er m a man wasn't too if it was a good er harvesting day, a man wasn't too at any price.
1984	And some aero aero aeroplane erm g er  er what er I think they were If I remember rightly, they were the  er Oh .
1984	Oh , never mind.
1984	Oh .
1984	Oh .
1984	And erm he was by the way he was the er step erm father in law of the man who erm  owned who was the erm building firm er in  er er Oh they've gone now.
1984	It's just been taken over by you know, it's gone into the big big time er Oh me, I forget his name now.
1984	Came back and there was a er  it couldn't turn cos there was erm Oh I'm forgetting my engineering terms but er you know it's a that's the .
0000	me.
0000	.me.
1984	Oh, he said, if we had carried on it would have been for somebody.
1984	If things were , not by so much.
1993	‘My child…’ she began hesitantly.
1993	‘You do not have to stay in to be with me, Jenna, ,’ she said softly.
1993	‘It is your colouring, .
1993	I'm doubly grateful that you spent the time with me, Jenna, , when you were probably pining to get back to your fiancé.’
1993	That is how she was able to leave such a large amount of cash to you, my .’
1993	‘Oh, God, Dr Neil.
1993	In his temporary absence, Miss Mates refreshed Sally-Anne's cup again, said gently to her, ‘Do not mind Dr Neil's manner, my .
1993	‘Have a bit of a doze, my .
1993	He is a saint, is he not, Norton, and Matey, my ?
1993	Balancing the tray, to which Mrs Darrell had kindly added the plate containing those cream cakes which she had not managed to devour, she heard her say to Dr Neil, ‘You really ought to go into society again, my .
1993	I am truly sorry, my cousin, but the girl is new, not yet trained.’
1993	‘Oh, ,’ said McAllister tragically.
1993	Oh, , thought Sally-Anne, there I go again.
1993	He had invited her to join the ladies' sewing circle, and even suggested that she might like to attend the Tuesday evening Bible readings which he ran — he was sure that ‘Miss Mates’ would release her for the hour and a half the readings usually took.
1993	‘Ah, but I am not a pretty young skivvy,’ said Dr Neil wickedly, ‘and Mr Sands does not wish to see me walk through the door.
1993	A look of relief passed over his own face when, the dreadful malaise gone, she croaked at him, ‘Oh, , what happened?’
1993	Sally-Anne did not know of this conversation, of course, and by the next day she was her usual bouncing, energetic self, and it being Monday not only was it wash-day — oh, — but summer cleaning also began again, with everything being put back, and the whole place was shining and sweet-smelling, so that , Wednesday having come round, McAllister had sunk down into Dr Neil's big armchair with a great, ‘Phew, I'm glad that's all over!’ amusing Matey, whose soft spot for the girl who seemed to be making Dr Neil more reconciled to his lot grew greater every day.
1993	‘Delightful, my .
1993	Not to thank you, I mean — and Rose — oh, …’ and her face crumpled, but the steely resolution which lay beneath her outward charm prevented her from giving way to the hysterics which she knew would take her over if she allowed herself to show any weakness.
1993	‘Oh, ,’ she wailed, ‘he must want his bag urgently to send for Eddie,’and then, irrelevantly, ‘Why aren't you at work, Rose?’
1993	She clutched the doll to her heart, and told herself to think of poor dead Effie whose fate had been so much worse than her own, and that should teach her to count her blessings as her aunt Nella had always said.
1993	God, McAllister, I shan't hurt you.
1993	Sally-Anne Tunstall, beloved daughter of Senator Jared Tunstall, arguably the richest man in the USA, and his wife Mary, niece of Orrin Tunstall, the American ambassador, society beauty, heiress, spoiled child of fortune, who had once thought that the world was her ball to play with, sat on her bed in an East End attic, dressed in her skivvy's clothing, grieving because she could not consummate her love for a poor doctor who had renounced the world over which she had once reigned.
1993	‘Now, my ,’ he said, ‘no need to take on so; you are young.
1993	But she responded to the kind note in his voice when he said, ‘Now, my , you are a clever girl and a brave one.
1993	‘My Honoria,’ it began, and then went on to enquire lovingly after her and the children.
1993	I am really impatient with you, my .
1993	Think how Matey will grieve!’
1993	Sally-Anne had a flash of memory of him just before their abortive lovemaking, remembered how she had felt him, so that she no longer saw his scarred face, but only Dr Neil, whom she loved.
1993	‘Oh, forgive me, my love,’ he said at last.
1993	It is McAllister who is to me, not Sally-Anne.
1993	‘Try to keep me away,’ he had whispered, ‘although it is exquisite torture for me these days, my McAllister, to have you so near, and be unable to stroke every bit of your delectable body.
1993	‘God,’ said her father.
1993	You were right to break with him if you decided that you had made a mistake in accepting him, but oh, my , your uncle Orrin tells me that he dare not inform your father of the dreadful things Havvie is hinting about you for fear of what he might do to Havvie.
1993	Neil Cochrane, holding the book in his hands, could not even weep over it; he was beyond tears, his hand on the page on which his love, whom he had sent away from him with scorn and mockery, had told of her love for him, and the hope and joy which he had given her.
1993	‘Mary, my , you will excuse us for a moment.
1993	Oh, McAllister, I have stopped making sense.
1993	How on earth was she to stop him — her Dr Neil who was so distracted by love that all his sense appeared to have left him?
1993	She crossed the room to him, put her hands on his lips, and said, ‘Hush, my Dr Neil, hush.
1993	‘And yes, of course I wish to marry you, and do you think, my love, that, as Matey would say, we have both been struck by the asylum mop, we are carrying on so wildly, and shall I ever be sane again?
1993	No point in going to bed, , he trilled, I thought you'd like a cup of tea.
1993	And Mum Knows Best, so when the Pig went off with its Tart, she told Jan never mind, , there's always people making a mess somewhere, you can always clean it up.
1993	‘Oh hello, , were you busy?’
1993	‘Look , Joe's just been up with a tray of sumptuous goodies.
1993	I was just beginning to stop sweating when Jan leaned over  and whispered: ‘Why didn't you tell me he was a nancy boy, ?
1993	Oh no , like I was saying to Basil, I don't mind what people get up to.
1993	‘That must have been awful,’ said Basil — Cherry again, now that he could talk about Men and the problems with them, !
1993	‘Your trouble, , is you're too hung-up.
1993	‘And if it's awful, ,’ he said philosophically, ‘you can always escape to Raglan's.
1993	God, let there be Guests, prayed Jessica, or let Daddy be away on business.
1993	God, thought Jessica, seeing the words in her best handwriting, God let it be all right when I get home and I'll never…
1993	God, make everything all right and I'll always be nice to people, even May and Izzy.
1993	Oh .
1993	Take what you need, .
1993	His chin was a ragged hobo grey, eyes mad with lack of sleep and Vision, my Alex, –n!
1993	‘I had an aunt who said once, ‘Derek’,’ he quavered like Flora Robson, '’Derek, boy, I thrive on Things on Toast, d'you know, one can't get the help these days.’
1993	‘Champagne tastes, my .’
1993	If I tried — my , it  would be civil war.
1993	‘Oh , yes, I am very flattered.
1993	It's Raymond's annual regimental luncheon — so grand, my !
1993	‘I was so well-behaved, my ,’ she told me over coffee, stretching like a mischievous cat.
1993	Well, it was so suitable, my , that the General's wife was wearing it too.
1993	‘My , what else could I do but join the Resistance?
1993	‘My ,’ she said, ‘I will never be in a hospital or an old people's home.
1993	‘My , how the days go by!
1993	The potatoes could cast an eye over Jean-Paul Sartre and reshape their destiny: no more chips in her house, non, non, my , pommes frites.
1993	The wind had turned it into an octopus and the old lady muttered, ‘Oh , oh lord, oh good heavens, what a nuisance.’
1993	Orchids to You,
1993	There was his head, bent close to a tousled blonde mop over a pile of papers.
1993	With satisfaction she noticed how her little hands were becoming calloused.
1993	God, she was nothing but skin and bone, and she'd been a tiny slip of a thing to start with.
1993	wave bobber — you've shown me a living rainbow.’
1972	When he had them so placed, he spurred ahead and drew , and the archers cut them down like corn.
1972	‘Faith, and so do I, but we're like to pay for it.
1972	He neither gains an ally nor sweetens an enemy, and say she brings but a token household with her, yet it will cost him to keep them.
1972	She was small and fair like her name, shy like her mother, and his favourite child, even than Thomas, for daughters are more fragile and vulnerable than sons, and she was his first daughter.
1972	And as for Mortimer, they shall pay still for him.
1991	Make me some cheese on toast, there's a .
1991	‘Better to live in the present, ,’ she said, ‘while you can.
1991	Mrs Jones,
1991	‘Oh ,’ said Ellen.
1993	Where's your auld ?’
1993	Stevie and Patsy Mulligan are the sons of a friend who has recently passed away.
1993	And the auld 's chattin' to Bernice just a' te corner there.
1993	After visiting me auld , we'll meet the others at Kimberly's house for a late supper.’
1993	Your brother left quite a few problems behind when he failed to take that corner.
1993	Hello, my , I'm so pleased you've called…’
1993	‘I already know about it, my , as does most of the world.
1993	‘I'm afraid we can, my .
1993	I'm now going to teach you a long-overdue lesson, my .
1993	Quite frankly, my , at the moment I don't give a damn what your feelings are.
1993	Dump your bags, , we'll take them up later.
1993	‘It's all right, my .
1993	Oh, !
1993	‘Go in and say we've found her, ,’ orders Lil.
1993	‘No thanks, .
1993	I am — deliberately — ten minutes late, both for the sake of a dramatic entrance and to show them that frankly, my , I don't give a damn.
1993	Because frankly, my , they don't give a damn.’
1993	But only if you let me pay, .’
1993	‘You'll need to take the second right after those lights, .
1993	‘Find a dybbuk of your own, .’
1993	But that puts you in your place, .
1993	If Rainbow won't entertain these girls, then maybe I should.
1993	‘It's the most important part of the whole ensemble, .’
1993	Mere mortals, Rainbow, as you so rightly say, would present no threat.
1993	Oh , has she blown it?
1993	That house of hers is crammed to the rafters with mothers and sisters-in-law and groupies like your Aunt Goldie.’
1993	‘Oh, don't worry, , we have.
1973	He paused at one point on a low hill and cried aloud — perhaps not without a touch of relish for the dramatic, characteristic of his age —‘William, little brother!
1973	Close by this spot wast thou murdered and thy innocence cast down!’
1973	‘William, my little angel!
1973	A man's voice replied, ‘Elizabeth, Elizabeth, you must have thought of these things fully as much as I!
1973	You are his friend, and must act accordingly.’
1973	Taking my arm as if in apology for a moment's neglect, Byron said, ‘My Bodenland, you must be acquainted with my fellow reprobate and exile.’
1973	‘You may give me a kiss, Mary, since it is soon to be your birthday.’
1973	‘Mary, , you upset my circulatory system when you parade these ideas you pinch from Percy,’ Byron said.
1973	‘Mary, , one night when I have made a better meal than I did tonight, I plan to go a little berserk, too, in order to have your solace.’
1973	And Shelley?
1973	Because our Claire is with child by Byron.
1973	The sun will never swing away from that casement window, for we have abolished time at a stroke, my spirit!
1973	Ah, Mary, Mary Shelley, how you were and are, beyond all women — and yet what was possible then was only possible because we were mere phantoms in the world, or so we saw it, and scarcely less than phantoms to each other.
1973	Mary!’
1973	‘My Joe!’
1973	‘You know I can't leave Shelley.
1973	‘Oh, Mary…’
1973	My Mary Godwin,
1973	Between your age and mine, Mary, a re-education has taken place.
1973	And you, my Mary, respected though your name is — you are insufficiently regarded as the first of that invaluable breed,preceeding them by at least one whole generation!
1973	Then would be the time to go seeking Mary again.
1973	My Mary had had a truer idea when she called Victor ‘The Modern Prometheus’.
1973	A fleeting recollection, as the dying are supposed to relive past episodes: recollection of my old sane ordered life now lost by two centuries, of my wife, my valued friends, even some of my esteemed enemies, and of my little grandchildren.
1993	Robyn nodded and tried to decide who she'd throttle first — Luke or Melissa.
1993	‘I didn't ask to sit down to dinner with them, I didn't ask to be ridiculed and insulted by , delightful Melissa!’
1993	‘Mummy and Daddy,’ he starts in English.
1993	It is John's wish,’ Babur says.
1993	Mum said, ‘, that's our flight.’
1993	‘The last time they called our flight she said, ‘That's the final call, .’
1993	Oh , Paul thinks.
1993	‘Oh, ,’ Paul says.
1993	‘It's his wish,’ Keith says, as if that explains everything.
1993	‘What's your wish, my sweet man?’ he asks.
1993	‘God in heaven!’ ejaculated Mr Beckenham on a tide of relief.
1993	God, what the devil had his poor ghost done to excite her vicious enmity?
1993	Since I am certain that my cousin Araminta will neglect to inform you of it, allow me to introduce myself.
1993	My boy, what a lovely surprise!’
1993	‘And now, Aunt Lavvy, I have you all to myself!
1993	‘God!
1993	‘Be sure I shall remember it, Aunt.’
1993	‘God in heaven, you are a witch!’
1993	‘Oh, my , I don't need help at all,’ she declared, ushering Theda inside a spacious saloon, its windows, open to the fresh air, letting in a good deal of light.
1993	‘Yes, my ,’ smiled her hostess.
1993	‘Lord!’ uttered Theda startled.
1993	‘lord in heaven!
1993	‘With that pearly skin of yours, ghost, that flame was inevitable!’
1993	‘I have brought you here, Miss Kyte,’ resumed Miss Merchiston in what was for her a pleasant tone, ‘that you may tell Mr Quatt of what passed between yourself and my mother.’
1993	‘Of course nothing can be formally arranged just at this present,’ went on Miss Merchiston, and Theda almost laughed out to see the burgeoning hope in the poor man's face, ‘for with Mama in this sad condition, I could not reconcile it with my conscience to leave her in the care of other hands.
1993	Did you shrink from marriage with me, indeed, ghost?
1993	‘ghost, I don't want you to float out of my life, to disappear without trace.
1993	‘God !
1993	‘My Rose, pray sit down again,’ begged Theda, softening.
1993	‘Theda, you must surely be able to see that for yourself.
1993	‘Oh, , how right you are!
1993	‘My Rose,’ Theda said with a smile, ‘you have so espoused Benedict's cause that you imagine it is enough to tell me all his unfortunate history to make me realise what I already know.
1993	‘God !
1993	‘Oh, Lord!’ she exclaimed, dropping to her knees.
1993	Lord, he did want her!
1993	Oh, Lord!
1993	‘My , Antoinette positively said ‘Kyte’, I am certain of it,’ one voice was saying.
1993	‘Quatt , my Mrs Tiverton,’ interpolated her companion, with a titter.
1993	‘Quite right, my ,’ agreed the other.
1993	‘My Rose, we have been hearing of your protégé.
1993	‘me!’ she gasped out.
1993	lord, how was she to endure it?
1993	lord,no .
1993	God!
1993	lord, what could she say?
1993	‘My Miss Kyte,’ said Lady Danby's voice, interrupting her reverie, ‘I am certainly going to take you to task for leaving my party so early.
1993	‘He has taken a marked fancy to you, my ,’ pursued the other.
1993	‘My ma'am, I assure you I don't look for matrimony.
1993	lord, one word from that dreadful old woman, and she was undone.
1993	‘Well, my , it is an old tale now.
1993	Like a drowning woman clinging to a frail piece of wreckage, she hung for life on to the bedpost while the images cluttered her mind: Benedict smiling; Caswell shocked; a loved face dying; the wasted face of Lady Lavinia dead, eyes open; Araminta's bitter, hating mouth; Rose's pleading smile for Benedict.
1993	lord, when she had so longed for him!
1993	ghost!
1993	‘Don't weep, ghost!
1993	God, as if I needed this complication!
1993	But you —’ his fingers reached across to take her face between his hands, and there was deep compassion in his gaze ‘— you, ghost, don't understand.
1993	‘lord, but we are poles apart!’
1993	‘lord in heaven!’
1993	Oh, lord, Rose will tell him!
1993	You know nothing of women if that is what you believe, my .
1993	‘God , of course!
1993	‘Oh, , Miss Theda, I wish you will think better of it!’
1993	‘knows why he has not been back here these few days!’ muttered the housekeeper fretfully.
1993	lord, she would have to go abroad!
1993	‘What is it, my ghost?’
1993	‘Oh, lord!’
1993	Caswell was unworthy, just as you said, and untrue, as Mama would have it.
1993	‘You were only a child, my ,’ sighed the Earl.
1993	‘ghost, did you imagine I would let it go to that hag of a cousin of mine?
1993	heaven, he wasn't the local lunatic, was he?
1993	‘All right, ?’
1993	‘No, but then how do you ever know that your little baby isn't going to grow up to be tall and elegant?’ she quipped with huge enjoyment.
1993	‘Hello, ,’ she smiled.
1993	And I saw a little shed that someone had made into a craft shop, and the woman said no one had been in for ages, and wasn't she pleased to see me…’
1993	‘Aren't we all, ?’
1993	‘God,’ he interrupted, ‘no wonder you get away with murder, eyes so wide one would swear you were innocent.
1993	me.’
1993	Oh , more unwitting genocide.
1993	Oh , out comes the erection, unsheathed like a family dog in the middle of the carpet, during supper.
1993	‘This child's loyalty is my greatest pleasure, and so useful.
1993	lord, she had to speak, she told herself, staring down at her hands gripped tight in her lap.
1993	‘And I shall look forward to having you read to me, my , while you are with us.
1993	‘But I can see you are still troubled, my ,’ observed the Queen kindly.
1993	And no need to fear that anyone outside this room will learn of it, my .
1993	‘Forget I asked, my .
1993	‘'TIS nought, my .
1993	Oh, God,he had !
1993	‘God,’ whispered Joanna, glancing at the sky.
1993	‘Oh, God, why didn't I call the villagers into the castle?’
1993	‘A cup of wine, my Isabel?
1993	‘me, I can see a lesson in manners will be called for.
1993	‘I've seen your husband before, my .

0000	reader,
1992	Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show, That she (she) might take some pleasure of my pain; Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know; Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain; I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe, Studying investions fine, her wits to entertain; Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburnt brain.
1993	‘My Roger, in London there are spies in the service of the Papacy, the Doge of Venice, the Emperor of the Romans, Ferdinand of Aragon…and the same is true of every capital in Europe.
1993	No one but Shallot himself so I pleaded not guilty and made my defence: I was Ralemberg's colleague, I had no grievance against him.
1993	‘Because, my nephew,’ Wolsey silkily intervened, ‘only I know what the seal actually looks like.
1993	And what did Uncle wish to impart?’
1993	‘My , Roger.
1993	Oh, , I thought, not much love lost here!
1993	‘I'll tell you in God's good time, as I will about the secret instructions Uncle gave me at Hampton Court.’
1993	‘In that case, my Roger, we learn French well and make friends with Monsieur Vauban because we can never return to England.’
1993	‘But you were Mr Russell's only child, my , and you must not doubt that he loved you, even if he didn't always make it perfectly apparent.’
1993	Then he said gently, ‘I don't think, my , that your father was always very wise.’
1993	‘Antoinette, my , you haven't met this young lady, who is paying a short visit from England.’
1993	What is your name, my ?’
1993	Such a boy.
1993	‘How fierce you are, my Rohan,’ the Baronne intervened, openly amused.
1993	‘My favourites, you boy.’
1993	You are always so impatient, my boy.
1993	We had no children of our own,’ the Baronne almost choked on the words, ‘but there was always Antoinette, my beautiful, radiant Antoinette, to me than any daughter could have been.
1993	‘God, after that, it was like a siege.
1963	‘Now you mustn't talk like that, .
1963	‘Now ,’ she said.
1963	‘I know, ,’ Mrs Hellyer said respectfully.
1963	She said, ‘Emmie , do you have to scrub the floor on a hot afternoon like this?’
1963	She said, ‘You know, , we love to have you in and out of the house, but sometimes I think you hang around Nick too much.’
1963	Nick's publishing friend fitted his glasses more securely on the bridge of his nose and said, ‘My chap — I thought it was charming.
1963	My chap you couldn't put them in a work of fiction.
1963	‘Sir, I am sending you my new book.
1963	‘Oh God,’ Emmie said, and went to the bathroom for rags.
1963	You poor, girl.’
1963	He was so quick, so  , so light.
1993	‘My good girl, you must be very naïve — as naïve, apparently, as my stepsister — if you think I'd contemplate even for one moment sharing these very cramped quarters with you.

1993	‘My , your aunt Bertha means well —’
1993	‘My , you know I have Daddy to care for, as well as Gran.
1993	Bertha had looked at her in thoughtful silence for several long moments before she'd said, ‘Lucy — I believe you could help me in this affair.’
1993	‘My Tom spoke of the place as an undeveloped shambles with Matt living there alone, although I've now heard that he and Silas accommodate a few guests.
1993	‘You can talk to him for me, my .
1993	Matt and I ran out of gas, for the simple reason that the old boy had forgotten to fill up while I was with the wholesaler.
1993	‘It began after my Tom had passed away and when Silas and this woman spoke of becoming engaged.
1993	‘My —she was referring to me as being bossy and domineering.
1993	‘My — don't allow his obsession for everything being first class at the Wilderness get under your skin.
1993	His tone had become thoroughly cynical; then he went on, ‘As it happens, I'm more than happy with old Matt near by.
1993	‘Thank you, my ,’ Matt said, then he spoke seriously to Silas.
1993	Now that he's gone she refers to him as her Tom.
1993	It was only family loyalty that prevented Lucy from admitting that her aunt's references to her Tom had never sounded convincing, and, giving a small sigh, she said, ‘Perhaps I understand more than you realise.’
1993	There was a tense silence until she said, ‘Silas, — who is this — this person ?’
1993	‘Silas,’ Doreen cooed.
1993	Silas, — I've come here to spend time with you.’
1993	Silas,…
1993	‘Be a girl and check that Ling has the hampers ready,’ he said.
1993	‘It's stupid to have three crammed into one seat while old Matt travels alone.’
1993	‘In any case, I've had about as much as I can take from your friend for today — thank you very much.’
1993	‘I'd like to see the old — er — the soul again.’
1993	‘Bertha — I see you're still your same sweet and gracious self,’ he commented on a sardonic note.
1993	‘boy — you're so like your father.
1993	He then unclipped his seatbelt and turned towards her, his arms enfolding her as he murmured, ‘You are a girl.
1993	Above her head Silas murmured, ‘I'll admit I've been slow — but we'll make up for it later, my .’
1993	‘Then hear this, my one — I love you.
1993	Silas — did I happen to tell you I love you?’ she queried shyly.
1993	‘Tomorrow, my , we'll drive to Hastings to buy an engagement ring.
1992	I'd say that leaves the way for us to concentrate on the robberies.’
1990	Sir,
1990	Members,
1990	Mr Young
1990	Mr Young,
1990	Member,
1992	Does my right hon. Friend realise that in dealing with things that we hold so we want to make sure that the European Community gives us a good bargain and that what we give to it will be given back to us?
1992	Oh , the hon. Gentleman is in a muddle.
1992	If she were interested in such a campaign, she could perhaps use as the model for it our own Speaker, whose radiant health and youthfulness make him the perfect epitome of a diet based on vegetarianism.
1992	Let me state a couple of fundamental principles that we hold .
1992	The House will recall my Adjournment debate of 22 January 1991 following the publication in December 1990 for the first time of the annual report by Her Majesty's inspector of constabulary, Mr. Geoffrey .
1992	Mr. painted a picture of a poorly funded, undermanned force under great pressure, and a chief constable with his hands tied behind his back by council rules and bureaucracy such that decisions on spending even minute amounts have to be referred to a committee, including items as minute as the installation of a telephone line.
1992	In all, Mr. threatened to withhold the certificate of efficiency if matters did not improve.
1992	Mr. has now returned to Derbyshire and has produced another interim report.
1992	Mr. says that almost no action that could be registered and measured by Her Majesty's inspector has yet been taken by the police committee.
1992	The council's main reaction to Mr. 's complaints of undermanning has been to cut the force even further.
1992	I hope that in Committee he will listen to the pleas of Members representing Greater London and the south of England because they are to my heart and may to some extent be to his.
1992	In a’ Colleague’letter circulated to all Members of Parliament, the Secretary of State for Education and Science warned us earlier in the year to beware of students who came to us during the recess pleading poverty.
1992	In his’ Colleague’letter, the Secretary of State referred to the benefit that students could previously have claimed.
1992	In his’ Colleague’letter the Secretary of State tells us that the uprating of student grants in 1990-91 was over and above the extra money made available through student loans.
1992	So Dr. Godman I feel I have been treated badly in this case and would be grateful if you would pursue this matter further.
1992	The matter is serious because if one inspects the photocopy of the letter one sees that he forged not only the heading but the’ Dr.
1992	We must increase demand for British goods by adjusting the exchange rate so that demand is channelled to British goods through the price mechanism, making our goods and exports more attractive and cheaper and imports .
1992	My friend — if I may so describe him — the previous Foreign Secretary, who resigned from the right hon. Lady's Government over Europe, was equally thrilled, although he did not express himself — he never does — in quite such colourful language.
0000	This study extends the work of a pilot study funded by ESRC (C/00/23/2220) which examined the interaction between parents and their infants in the first 12 months of life.
1993	Taking the wraps off Diana
1993	TO SOMEONE who has, in the past, had her intelligence insulted by experts, it presented no problem at all, last week, to respond to two programme makers with a sceptical, ‘Pull the other one, , it plays The Bells Of St Mary's.’
1993	‘Stuff is too now.
1993	I swear by all I hold the Koran, my wife, child and mother I had nothing to do with this.’
1993	No doubt the heads were dropping all round — oh , what's happening to us?

1993	They've already written to the Secretary of State and said Secretary of State we're going to send this to you because it is a departure but please Secretary of State do not call it in do not exercise your powers.

1993	Sir Ralph Grunte,(‘the ‘e’ is sounded, boy, as in Bronte’) stepped out of the next stall with pee on his brightly polished brown brogues.
1993	‘Well, my ,’ he said, pressing his knees against Amaranth's, ‘so it's your intention to stand for Parliament?’
1993	There goes old Willie, thought Joshua, the non-playing captain of the Wets, who was finally persuaded to advise Margaret Thatcher that famous November that ‘the game was up’.
1993	She wondered whether ‘John’ would do the decent thing and send Ralph to the Lords.
1993	Although what use could Alfred have for any of them? she wondered.
1993	He had either supported Michael Heseltine in his leadership bid (‘disloyal to Mrs Thatcher’) or had failed to turn up to a multitude of constituency functions, wine and cheeses, bring and buys.
1993	Grunte, who affected never to have sought office —‘too many people dependent on me, boy, wheels of commerce and all that’— would have been only too delighted to accept the seals of any office.
1993	‘My Mrs Ormsby Gore

1992	Hail, O holy offspring of kings, Charles, to Christ!
1993	Innocent had misjudged the character of Otto, as he later admitted in a letter to Philip Augustus: "If only, son, I had known the character of Otto who now calls himself Emperor, as well as you…
1985	Why not the old 23rd?— at least a decent bit of poetry.

1985	‘So like our friends from the secret services’ Sprague observed.

1966	‘Heavenly father,’ Midwinter intoned.
1966	‘What are you doing in the dark, ?’ she said, swinging into the room and switching all the lights on.
1993	‘My Shah,’ said the headmaster, ‘this is stuff from the dawn of time.
1993	Absolutely, my boy!
1993	‘They do indeed wear ‘peculiar shoes’, my Wilson!
1993	‘My Wilson,’ he said, ‘all you need to know is that it is not yet come.

1993	‘Please don't apologize, my Wilson.

1992	The back wall of the First Church is littered with scrap pieces of paper on which are written things like PLEASE HELP AUNTIE JOAN THROUGH THIS PHASE OF THE TREATMENT or GOD, HELP ALL THE PEOPLE I SAW ON WATERLOO STATION THIS WEEKEND AND PRAY FOR ALL, ALIVE AND DECEASED, AT 110 HOLDEN ROAD, FINCHLEY.
1992	‘Oh Jesus Christ!’

1991	God bless you my Eliza.
1991	Meantime it gives us great consolation to know that you and our children are well.
1991	And my little Eliza, is she as pretty as she was?
1991	And good-tempered little Charley…
1991	‘My Mother, Mrs Mitchell says, ‘Do let us know if you mean to bring home a little convict.’’
1991	My Eliza,
1991	Must now conclude trusting my that every blessing will attend you and trusting I may find you well when I return — kiss Fritz [?]for me and believe me to remain Eliza
1991	My Eliza,
1991	I cannot tell you my Eliza how great a shock I sustained.
1991	But at the end of all I sigh and think if I could but see old England again, and the , treasures it contains, I would contentedly sit down at my working table and stroke, stroke away to the end of the chapter, that is health permitting.’
1991	‘My Mrs Mitchell,
1991	I trust my Eliza you are still well and that you received my letter.
1991	‘How are the children?’ she asked Mrs Mitchell in a letter of 28 May, ‘Do they appear to retain any recollections of papa and Mamma?

1982	He consigned the thought, as a gift, to one of the two he held most .
1982	The pleasure he felt, and the calmness, and the determination burned as as the trees in the forest.
1982	But now, my Siward, I think the time has come to be provoked.’
1992	James Cossins recalled ‘the fun of the supper parties after filming all day in the  baking heat of the sand dunes around Almeria, and the joy that ensued when, after a suitable amount of alcohol, Roy Kinnear could be persuaded to do his celebrated impression of a one-armed golfer’.

1990	An example of the application of Foucault to the ‘urban’ sphere is and Wolch's research on what Giddens would no doubt call the ‘sequestrated region’of North American inner cities.
1990	But and Wolch's main point is that the daily lives of those dependent on welfare are suffused in largely intangible and invisible ways by the institutions on which they are dependent.
1992	And then, when I was taking the exhibition down, a couple of women helped me and they said, ‘Why are you so angry, ?’

1989	Back in I 986, for example, the Nuclear Energy Agency estimated that the Sizewell ‘s' nuclear-power station now being built in Suffolk would be one-third cheaper than an equivalent coal-fired station at a 5% rate of return; at 10% the agency thought it would be .
1989	Jewels worn in remembrance of ones lost, or exchanged between lovers as tokens, were extremely popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, although the ubiquitous lockets containing tresses of hair were perhaps the least subtle of these keepsakes. fit a time when the language of such things was far better understood than it is today, hearts and flowers, birds and beasts and a multitude of other symbols were incorporated into jewellery design to signify romantic love, to represent those sentiments and virtues which were the major preoccupation of the day.
1989	If you would like to help, please write a letter stating the following:’ Mayor Gordon, I have heard about the work of the Buklod Centre and the programmes it runs for the hospitality women, including health education, English lessons, income-generating projects and night care for children.

1993	Robert, yes, Robert, isn't it, boy.’
1993	Oh, .
1993	With the exception of Glastonbury, who produced the occasional ‘Oh , I don't know’ sound, those present were also united on the general untrustworthiness of the late Trueman.
1993	‘Oh !
1993	‘My boy,’ said Gooseneck.
1993	‘My , boy.’
1993	The Commander.
1993	Not really the sort of thing that old Boy Glastonbury, who was then chairman, could have been expected to deal with.
1993	‘My boy,’ he said, ‘the choice is between feeding your mind or their bodies: I give priority to the former.’
1993	‘Well, of course, old Fagg is a great man for believing whatever suits him and obviously the notion that this was an inside job is unlikely to appeal.
1993	‘No, no, my fellow.
1993	‘Oh, I'm so sorry, my boy.

1993	‘Your kind instincts do you credit, my Robert, but have no fear, I have no desire to torture our Islamic friends.’
1993	‘You appear surprised, my boy.
1993	‘Perfectly, my man.’
1993	I must have unnerved you, boy.
1990	‘Oh, ,’ said a lady nome, faintly.
1990	‘Well, it's better than sitting around wringing our hands and saying, ‘Oh , oh , the humans are coming and we shall all be squashed.’’

1991	I sneaked a glance to my left but all I could see was a rather attractive young nurse wheeling a chair-ridden white-haired old down the corridor towards us.

1988	‘Oh, ,’ said Loretta, trying to sound contrite in spite of her secret relief.
1988	Oh, ,’ she added, a new thought striking her, ‘it doesn't give one great confidence in the police, does it?’
1988	‘Loretta,’ she read, ‘I've just come back from an official trip to Italy, and I squeezed in a visit to a peace camp while I was there.
1988	Oh , I think you'd be more at home in Dr Sykes's little classes.

1993	‘Our wish,’ echoed his wife.
1993	‘Martin is a Protestant, ,’ said Mrs Roberts.
1989	‘From what Valesio's widow has told me, it's that her husband's contacts with the gang began with a telephone call that was simply a signal for him to go to some prearranged meeting-place.

1992	So  if you think about it a therapeutic group could certainly use suggestive therapy like hypnosis and my guess is that most successful groups like Alcoholics Anonymous or groups of people who wanna stop smoking or do slimming and things like that succeed for that reason, cos every member of the group reinforces every other member with a kind of group super ego and says look, you mustn't smoke, you mustn't drink, you mustn't put on weight and it, it reinforces every individual's erm  super ego by means of identification with the shared value of the group and  similarly reduces feelings of shame and guilt if the individual fails the group, cos next week when they come back they say oh , I've put on five pounds, erm that they're gonna feel bad about it because it offends against the ideal of the of the group if it's Weight Watchers or something.

1993	‘And you never seem to have any fun, do you, ?’

1991	‘I think, my Shiona, you've rather got that the wrong way round.
1991	The only one I'm worried about doing things behind my back, my Shiona, is your sweet self.’
1991	‘In spite of your intuition, my Shiona, Janice is a much nicer person than you, and far more suited to be Kirsty's mother.’
1991	‘So put me right, my , since you keep insisting I'm mistaken.
1991	‘Why, my Shiona?
1991	‘This is my own room, my Shiona.’
1991	‘Don't worry, Shiona.
1991	‘I mean, my Shiona, that I must have your absolute assurance that you don't intend trying to spirit her away again.’
1991	‘Oh, no, my Shiona, I fear I have never been wrong about you.
1991	‘My poor, Shiona.’

1991	‘It was my intention, my Shiona, to tear you apart.’
1991	‘My Shiona…
1991	‘Besides which, my Shiona, I've waited long enough for you, and I've just come all the way from Loch Lomond to propose to you.
1991	‘I believe in fairy-stories too, my .’
1991	‘I've never pursued any man in my life!’ she flared, stung by his disparaging ‘’as much as by what he seemed to believe.
1991	You insult my intelligence, my .’
1991	Sarella wished he would stop calling her his .
1991	‘Well, you might not have, my ,’ he added unfuriatingly, and apparently impervious to the effect he was having, ‘though I by no means concede that point.
1991	‘Even you can't go against the wishes of a dead autocrat like Uncle,’ replied Peter, ‘though it's probably your ambition!
1991	‘Your disappearance, my ,’ he said with a slight bow, ‘would speak louder than words.’
1991	He's the , sweetest boy who —’
1991	‘So you see, my , you really are wasting your time.
1991	‘Because, my ,’ Marc gave a perceptible sigh, ‘as I've already suggested, if you're not going to play it my way you can best show your regard for him by taking up my alternative offer of an airline ticket before he returns.
1991	Only one thing was clear: she mustn't hurt Peter.
1991	‘Pigeons always come home to roost, my .’
1991	‘The fact is, my boy, you've entered into a liaison with a woman who is totally unsuitable on every count.’
1991	You, my , thought you were being particularly clever.
1991	‘Forgive me, my ,’ he ground out, ignoring the scarlet imprint on the side of his face, ‘it seems I misread you at every turn — how extraordinary!
1992	‘Is this man pestering you, ?’
1992	‘Well, that soon sorted him out, didn't it, ?
1992	Oh , if only you'd explained it all to me last night!’ she said accusingly to Fran.
1992	Oh, , oh, , this is all turning into a rather nasty mess, isn't it?
1992	Nothing nasty, you'll be relieved to know — this isn't the sack, Miss Williams, me, no!’
1993	I don't envy you having to tell the lady that she'll have to spend the rest of her holiday with her wrist in plaster!’
1993	On the other hand, Lindsey found herself thinking, if Niall smiled at her the way he had smiled a few minutes ago, the lady probably wouldn't even need an anaesthetic!
1993	‘Oh !’
1993	‘We certainly have, my .’
1992	‘Oh, — you poor old hag!’ her friend murmured sardonically, grinning as she deftly caught hold of the cushion Laura had sent flying across the room towards her.
1992	‘My Laura,’ he drawled smoothly, looking down at her flushed cheeks, the blue eyes glinting with indignation, and her full lips trembling with rage and fury.
1992	‘I can assure you, my Laura, that I have neither the inclination nor the energy to lay my hands on your fair body,’ he drawled sardonically.
1992	‘But, my Laura, that's exactly what you were doing — only five minutes ago!’
1992	‘I mean, my Laura, that, since you are married to me — and I do not intend to give you a divorce — any question of your remarriage to anyone else simply doesn't arise!’
1992	‘Let us not forget Marissa…!’
1992	It just breaks my heart, honey, to think of your poor, cousin in such pain,’ the other woman murmured sympathetically, her eyes glistening with tears as she begged Laura to sit down and make herself comfortable.
1992	‘Oh, , I hope I haven't said the wrong thing?
1992	‘You won't believe it, but my mother-in-law has shoved me permanently up in the attic with the children,and we're expected to stay up there all the time.
1992	‘Oh, !
1992	In the end, our mother-in-law was yelling louder than the children!’
1992	‘My Laura!
1992	However, this was clearly not the moment in which to tell his Laura that she looked magnificent when she was angry, and he hastened to set the record straight.
1990	‘Oh, !
1990	‘I know you did, , and I appreciate it, I really do, and so will your father when he's had time to think about it; but you must admit, he does have a point — about David Markham, I mean.
1993	Oh, , she hadn't made a very good impression on the fabulous Dr Kent.
1993	‘Goodnight, .’
1993	‘It was quite understandable, .
1993	‘Oh, , no time for that, I'm afraid,’ said Nigel, getting up.
1993	‘Oh, — what happened?’
1993	Oh, no, , she doesn't live here any more.’
1993	‘My girl, you've hardly started!
1993	‘My Juliet, how many more times do I have to tell you I'm doing this because it interests me?
1993	‘My , your real mother has been looking after you for the past twenty years,’ said Miss Rose sharply.
1993	I'm sorry, , I don't know that name at all.
1993	‘Oh, you're back early, .
1993	‘All right, ?’ asked her mother, keeping her gaze on the television screen.
1993	‘Is that likely, ?’ said Irene.
1993	‘I did warn you, ,’ said Irene.
1993	Oh, , what an embarrassing state of affairs, thought Juliet, as she filed them away.
1993	Oh, , thought Juliet, as she crossed the grass towards the river.
1993	‘Only by letter, .
1991	‘Well, there's more than one flat for rent in London, isn't there?’ their father chipped in to declare, and then, with a fond look at his wife, ‘And if there isn't, my — well, I'm sure, for such a good cause, we could consider letting Leith and Sebastian have the inheritance from their grandfather before they're twenty-five.’
1991	The root cause for her worry, for her looking back instead of forward, was her brother Sebastian and how, a week ago, as casual as could be, considering his name was on the mortgage agreement the same as hers, she had received a postcard from him.
1991	‘Naturally, he's seen to it that his commitments are met, hasn't he, ?’
1991	heaven, what a man!
1991	‘Oh, I expect so, ,’ her mother replied, quite obviously thrilled at the lovely long letter she had received from her adored son.
1991	Oh, the love, thought Leith, having just realised that, heartsick for a sight of Rosemary, he must have been hoping that Rosemary was back and that she might, if asked, come over for a cup of coffee.
1991	‘I do hope that's not my lasagne I can smell burning, my ,’ and while she moved swiftly to check the oven and to find that not a thing was burning, Naylor was saying, ‘We'll see you at the weekend, Travis.’
1991	Oh, , Leith thought, he's panicking.
1991	Oh, , she thought, half an hour late, and I get a persecution complex — of course people weren't staring at her.
1991	Oh, heavens, had Naylor, by seeing she was hurt, seen too that she cared deeply for him?
1992	She was an only child, and well aware that her father's wish was to have grandsons.
1992	Oh, God, how am I going to live without him…?
1991	But it seems I've been a bit blasé about pregnancy's being ‘a perfectly natural physical state’— Dr Newne hit his surgery roof when I casually mentioned flying to St Lucia!
1991	‘Oh, .
1991	But I'm very proud of you, and your mother would have been, too…you worked harder than most to get that degree, my , even putting your health at risk…’
1991	‘Oh, , I hardly know what to say!’
1991	‘I'm well aware of that, my .’
1993	God, was she out of her mind?
1993	‘Because Ruth, one, there was nothing to hold on to.
1993	‘God, Steve, after tonight you're going to have to take the pledge…join a monastery —’
1993	‘God, did it mean so very little to you that you can't remember every last detail of it?’ he questioned derisively.
1993	Oh, God, she was holding Maria Luisa's child in her arms.
1993	Oh, God, they had a baby, together they had a baby!
1993	God, all this was none of her business anyway.
1993	God, but I gave you my heart and my very soul —’
1993	You, Ruth, with your successful company, your beauty, your intelligence, how could you let your sensibility come up with the very idea that Maria Luisa's baby is mine?’
1993	‘It isn't mine, Ruth.
1992	‘God, Rory,’ he murmured, ‘you're driving me out of my mind!’
1992	heaven, what now?
1993	‘She tends to get a bit befuddled, poor old .’
1993	‘Have you seen them, Mandy, ?’
1993	Have you seen my glasses, ?’
1993	‘Then I guess you and I are toast, my .
1993	‘And with what shall we light it, Liza?’
1993	‘Oh, ,’ Charity said with soft sympathy.
1993	Nelson, having appointed her Anpetuwi's own version of ‘Abby’, took the trouble to seek her out to consult her about a problem he was having with the chambermaid, Billie.
1993	Her ‘Abby’ voice, Nelson would call it.
1993	Charity, , we need a doctor,’ she whispered.
1993	Caroline, —’
1993	‘His Excellency is waiting for you, my .’
1993	‘Pay no attention to my grandson, my ,’ she said.
1993	‘My ,’ he said.
1993	‘I never remember which it is you American girls prefer, my , coffee or tea — or is it chocolate?
1993	‘It would give me great pleasure, my child.’
1993	‘Sit down, , and visit.’
1993	‘Oh, my !
1993	I am not your — your , or whatever that silly word means.’
1993	She was holding on for life, leaning into him, lifting on tiptoe so that he could gather her close, hold her tightly in his arms, while his tongue slipped into her mouth, while his hand swept up her ribs and lightly cupped her breast…
1993	‘How does that sound, ?
1993	Do you, ?’
1993	‘Did you enjoy yourself yesterday, my ?’ she asked.
1993	‘Yes, ?
1993	Someone from your very own country, my .
1993	‘Oh, please, my , don't disappoint me!
1993	‘There you are, ,’ Anna said as Caroline stepped into the room.
1993	I am not your ‘’, and I resent —’
1993	Everything about him was so to her now; his smile, his face, the soft huskiness in his voice that told her he wanted her.
1993	Would it say, ‘Miss Bishop, Thank you for your recent enquiry, but…’ which was what the letters from Parsons and FIT had said.
1993	‘Miss Bishop,’ she read aloud.
1993	But he ignored her, his mouth moving slowly over hers, not with anger, not even with desire, but with something so sweet, so , that Caroline began to tremble.
1992	When you run out of money you'll have to use the only asset you have left, and then, my Paige, I'll have you!’

1992	‘Just this, coz.
1992	‘Oh, , have I upset you, Paige?
1992	lord, but it hurt.
1992	‘Paige, my child, come in, come in,’ he invited warmly, sounding almost as if he was expecting her.
1992	Come in, my , and tell me all about it,’ he urged, and for the second time in just over twenty-four hours Paige burst into tears.
1992	‘My Paige, at my age, nothing seems as hopeless as it does to you.
1992	‘Ah, Paige, my , you're just the person I need.
1992	‘Well, my , Travis is pretty much a law unto himself,’ Jonas pacified, watching his grandson make himself comfortable on the top step.

1993	‘Rosie, , last night was an experience.

1993	Let old Miguelito charm a new generation of English roses — Shelley had outgrown him, although she would always keep a special place in her inner being for that lovely evening when she and only she had had his sweet and undivided attention…
1993	‘That might be true of you, Shelley, , but remember, I run a successful business as well as a medical practice, so having a wife as well shouldn't make much difference.’
1993	‘I know, my .
1993	Never ever say that hope is gone, my .
1993	‘That sweet boy Miguel is giving him a lift.’
1993	‘sweet boy?’
1993	‘What did you say, ?’
1993	But not if that sweet boy is anywhere around…
1993	Ever since we met, my , so gently and subtly you've been teaching me, you and Miguelito, and instead of thanking you I had this attack of childish pique and blamed you for hurting my feelings!
1993	She paused and looked at his face again.
1993	Her voice low and full of emotion, she went on, ‘Take no notice of me rambling away like this, , Miguelito.
1993	‘Not angry, , no.
1993	‘Well, well, well — I do believe our Sister Hennessy is speechless!’
1993	‘My girl, nothing I could do could possibly undermine your authority,’ he drawled lazily.
1993	God, she was lovely.
1993	God, what had he done to her?
1993	‘God, how could anyone do that?’
1993	‘My girl, you were sitting on my lap!’
1993	Oh, , poor little tyke.
1991	‘My child, is it possible you're embarrassed?
1991	‘My little castaway,’ he drawled, ‘surely you didn't imagine I was offering myself as companion for the night?
1991	‘My girl, it was no hardship to hold you in my arms for a while, I assure you!’
1991	‘My young woman,’ he drawled, ‘must you shy away like a startled horse every time I get within yards of you?
1991	‘My child,’ said Mrs Vaughan, a look on her face Leonora could have sworn was relief.
1991	‘Penry was rather mysterious about you, my ,’ said the latter, and patted one of the dining chairs ranged along the wall.
1991	heaven, child, you were so lucky to survive!’
1991	Or perhaps you don't know about that — goodness, , you've gone a very funny colour!’
1993	‘Katya,’ said Lydia with a frozen smile, ‘is planning on wearing a scarlet dress to the wedding.’

1993	‘You're not to think of it, my .’
1993	‘Oh, ,’ Sophie laughed, ‘that's a bit dictatorial.
1993	Then it was Edward's turn, and after that he said, ‘I'm glad you approve, my .
1993	‘Oh, ,’ Sophie said inadequately, then sat silently for a long minute.
1993	‘My !
1993	‘My , don't look so amazed.
1993	The smile on her sweet mouth quickly faded though the moment the door was opened and she at once took in the unusual pallor of Cara's skin and the fact that, if she wasn't mistaken, her sister had recently been crying.
1993	Thoughts of her sister and all that she must be going through started to get to her, and, as love and conscience did a double act, she couldn't help thinking that surely she could do more.
1993	‘Oh, ,’ Fabia muttered, trying to look intelligent but an alternator meaning nothing to her.
1993	‘Yes, ?’ her mother prompted.
1993	‘And although he's much better, the love isn't out of the woods yet.
1993	There was a hint of a smile on his face anyhow when, ‘I think, then, my , that as far as possible you'd better keep your distance from me,’ he stated.
1993	But, ‘Oh, my ,’ he followed on, and tenderly, with one finger, he traced the outline of her left breast.
1993	I confess I meant to hurt your pride — but, oh, Fabia,’ he said softly, and, his aggression all at once split asunder, he reached for her, took her in his arms, and gently cradled her to him.
1993	‘I'm not Superman, my ,’ he made her bruised chin immediately better with that warm-sounding ‘my ,’‘so what else could I do — and I own that I wasn't thinking at all too clearly — but appeal to the pride I'd seen in you?’
1993	Fabia was staring at him, struck dumb, when suddenly he let go one of her arms, placed an arm about her shoulders and, looking deeply into her eyes, said throatily ‘My , , Fabia, cannot you see how it is for me?’
1993	‘My ,’ he translated for her.
1993	‘Oh, — jealousy?’ she queried softly.
1993	‘Oh, my heart,’ Ven breathed, and held her close up against him for long, long happy minutes.
1993	‘Oh, little love,’ he breathed, and while from his adoring tone she knew herself forgiven, ‘I — don't know quite how to tell you this —’He paused, but, clearly deciding that there was only one way, he proceeded to completely stagger her when, ‘It is a fact, my , that I did not, and never have, promised an interview to your sister, or to anyone else representing Verity magazine.’
1993	‘Oh, .
1993	Thank you, love!’ he declared fervently, and, as his head came down and he tenderly touched her mouth with his, ‘We'll get married soon,miláčku ,’he decreed.

1993	Oh oh bit frightening isn't it?
1994	oh, oh , oh no
1994	Oh .
1994	Oh .
1989	yeah, well let me just read you two or three verses from Exodus, chapter forty, this is what it says  then the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle and Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle and throughout all their journeys whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle the sons of Israel would set out, but if the cloud was not taken up then they did not set out until the day that it was taken up, for throughout all their journeys the cloud of the Lord was on the tabernacle by day and there was fire in it by night, in the sight of all the house in Israel  and if you were to turn over to kings you've got a, you've got a similar thing there with the dedication of the temple and as Be Ben was saying the power really it's the it's the presence of God, the shine, the glory, that cloud of, and so what, what, what catches the Lord Jesus up is really the glory of God here he is, the, the riseness, the glorified Christ being called up into heaven in the, in the glory, what he's been glorified, so he withdraws his physical, physical presence from one place here on earth to present there on the throne and yet by the holy spirit to be every where  now Jesus then, he didn't cease to be truly man at either his resurrection or at his ascension, he stays man, God, the God man all the way through  and it's still true today he is the God man today and that's important for you and me, think of the very worse experience that you have ever had in your life, think of the very worse experience that could happen to you, with the exception of you know that of, of say total failure of some awful sin, the worse thing, maybe a loss of someone to you, someone very close to you, er, er, a bereavement, the most awful experience you have had  well  he has gone through, he has known that experience, he has, has tempted in all points like as we are  he knows our frame, he remembers were dust and he has been there and it is a man who has experienced those same experiences that you and I experience day by day, year after year, it is a man who has gone that, who has walked that path, who is in heaven interceding and praying for us, we'll stop there cos time has gone  erm we'll stop there, we won't go on otherwise I'll get into trouble   During this past month some of the questions in the New Testament, the first one we looked at you remember was that question that Jesus asked of his disciples, do you believe that I am able to do this, then we looked at a question which the disciples asked of Jesus, why could we not cast it out  last week we looked at another question, are only a few people going to be saved  and this morning I'd like us it's the final one of these questions not that there aren't other questions in the New Testament and scores, scores of others but were just looking at four er throughout this month, I'd like us to look this morning for one at, for a few minutes, at one that Jesus asked of a man who confronted him, I'd like to read a few verses from Luke chapter eighteen, Luke chapter eighteen  I'm gonna read from verse thirty five, it's the well known account of blind Bartimaeus, Luke chapter eighteen and verse thirty five  and he came about that as Jesus was approaching Jericho a certain blind man was sitting by the road begging, now hearing a multitude going by he began to inquire
1989	Lord we, we want to be of use to you, we want to be of service to you, we want to be salt and light in our communities, we want to be your labourers, working together with you.
1989	He wrote what must have been the one of the shortest letters of all time, and he wrote back to the editor of The Times and he said, sir, in answer to your question what is wrong with the world
1989	And the, whilst the one side was good there was the other side, and when he heard that the inheritance required that he marry Ruth, oh !
1993	Oh .
0000	Oh me!
1992	And some old old lady fell out, off the edge of the kerb
0000	Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday Antony, Happy Birthday to you
0000	You go on through and si sorry seven is a pointer, eight is a Jack Russell which apparently is rather snappy and used for rabbiting, so I'm told, nine is Dalmatian , number ten's a labrador, golden coloured, guide dog main use and so on and then oh , it's finished, the programme's stopped.
1992	He stood there, no I don't mean that, I mean me rubbish, oh , and he said erm  er, sorry, he started sipping his coffee, he never said anything and then he says I've got some bad news for you and I said oh my God no, car accident, I just heard it on the radio  he said no, then he told me, oh God I nearly
1992	Oh

1992	Oh .
0000	Oh, .
0000	Bitter constraint and sad occasion compels me to disturb your season dew.
0000	Confirm then I resolve, Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe , so I love him that with him all deaths I could endure without him live no life.’
0000	Whether she is consciously twisting logic, or just, poor girl, confused, I'm not sure, but at the end it's quite clear ‘So I love them that with him all deaths I could endure, without him live no life’, that she's got into a world of fantasy because the one thing that is of course not in question is that Adam should die and that she should live on, which appears to be what she's referring to here.
0000	Oh , what?
0000	I mean let me not allege that you're one of the worst, but you say ‘Motorists, erm may we congratulate you on the acquisition of your new vehicle.
0000	I'm glad you like my essay, but I don't like what you're doing’, or would he think ‘oh I've got to put with this or she's going to write a bad report on me’.

0000	Also at the game was Mickey Ianotta, who told Brian yet again, basic errors cost United .
0000	. And I thought’ Oh , where am I going?’
0000	Martin Foyle and Lee Nogan, oh , they got in each other 's way when there was an empty net in front of them.
