1991	Dear Friend
1991	This isn't necessarily so and by neglecting to make a valid, legal Will families put at risk the security and future of their nearest and dearest.
1991	Dearest Sandra,
1991	Do not forget me dear comrade.
1989	At the beginning of the book a dear friend, Charlie, another immigrant boy, leaves for Russia with his family — for the land, they hope, of the free.
1989	Kapuscinski's first two books will serve to deter any cult of the dear dead kings in question.
1989	In The Periodic Table he mentions a woman ‘dear to my heart’ who was murdered at Auschwitz: but the book on Auschwitz does not discuss his relationship with her.
1986	My picked man of countries: ‘My dear sir,’—
1986	Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
1986	Very dear Siegfried.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, you may keep your door closed and not answer when I ring the bell, you may refuse to answer my letters or return my calls when I leave a message  on your answering machine, but sooner or later we are bound to meet and this time I will not let you fob me off with a smile.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, you have been seen doing circuit training with Korchnoi and the Brighton and Hove Albion football team.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, you may be amused to hear that one of my sons spotted you the other day training with Korchnoi and the Brighton and Hove Albion football team.
1991	Dragging the pad towards him he found a clean page and wrote: Dear Harsnet, I know you never answer my letters or return my calls, and I know that you handed over your notes to me on the understanding that I could do what I liked with them and not bother you, but I have to say that while there is much in them that I admire, as I will always admire much in you, no matter what, there is also much in them that seems to me to be puerile and, to put it mildly, bigoted.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, tearing the sheet in his hurry to turn over the page, I know you never reply to letters and refuse to answer the door or the phone.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, I am not sure if this will reach you and I know that even if it does you will not reply.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, I want simply to tell you that work on your notes connected with the Big Glass is at last under way and that I have remained scholarly and impartial throughout what has not been an easy task, in view of what you say about me and especially about my family, and which you must have known would give offense.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, just a brief note to let you know that work on the MSS you left with me is proceeding apace (at long last!) and will soon be ready for publication.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, my son, who is a keen supporter of Brighton and Hove Albion Association Football Club (The Seagulls), and who frequently goes to the sports centre of the University of Sussex to watch his team at their indoor training, was surprised the other day to see two figures distinctly older than the rest of the players.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, this is a message from the past.
1991	And Goldberg, in his pad: Dear Harsnet, it may surprise you to hear that after all these years I am finally at work transcribing the notes you entrusted to me so many years ago, with a view to eventually publishing them.
1991	And Goldberg, pushing the typewriter from him, dragging the pad towards him, Dear Harsnet, I am well aware of the fact that you have cut yourself off from all your old friends, and that you wish to have nothing more to do with them.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, I am well aware of the fact that for some years now you have cut yourself off from your past and not deigned to reply to the letters of your friends, or even to return their calls, taking refuge in your answering machine and pretending not to be in when they rang at the bell.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, it has taken me longer than I had at first anticipated to work my way through the manuscript you.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, my son, who was only a very small boy  when you last saw him, happened the other day.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, my son Michael, whom you may not even remember, the fair one with the glasses.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, something happened recently which has prompted me to write to you in this unsolicited way, though God knows we were once.
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, why do you persist in this rigmarole of refusing even to acknowledge my existence?
1991	Dear Harsnet, he wrote, the distance between London and Brighton is not very great, and you have even been seen in the vicinity of Brighton, so why not call in on an old friend?
1991	Dear Moira, he wrote, we will have to reach an understanding.
1991	It is in our interests as designers in this field to ensure that the ‘pub tradition’ that we all hold so dear remains a living tradition.
1990	‘Oh, my dear,’ he said, ‘you'll really have to get used to me going to Mass.
1990	‘Yes, my dear, from the moment we're married you'll be Countess of Woodleigh.’
1990	‘Perhaps, my dear fellow, since you're some sort of detective, you'd try to get through on the telephone to the Carabinieri.
1990	‘Oh now, dear me, Sergeant, let's not beat about the bush.’
1990	‘It reminds me of my dear father one day at Sandwich,’ she was saying, ‘when we were picnicking on the sands and we had arranged to meet him at the nineteenth hole.
1990	‘Oh dear,’ said Bramble out loud.
1990	‘Dear me,’ she said, ‘one is surprised to find foreigners in a place such as this.
1990	‘Oh dear, oh dear’, said the lady, ‘Nothing, but nothing, is ever what it seems.’
1990	You, my poor dear lady,’ and he turned here to the other great detective, ‘have as one says ‘raided the vegetable garden’.
1990	‘My dear Vivien,’ said his aunt, ‘I do commend you on your herb garden as well as on your choice of bride.
1990	Your dear new uncle-in-law whom I was fortunate enough to encounter on the morning train from Paddington agrees that it would be nice if our friends from the constabulary were to join us.’
1990	‘You see dears,’ said the old lady, ‘no one, least of all a great detective, believes what they read in the newspapers.’
1990	‘Oh dear.’
1990	‘Oh, my dear,’ said Peggy, going to her.
1990	Oh dear, Peggy thought — the local chemist .
1990	‘Dear me,’ she murmured.
1990	‘Oh dear,’ she said, again.
1990	‘Oh dear,’ Mrs Feather said.
1990	‘Thank you, my dear.
1990	And Conroy dearest, go up to Mummy's room and wait there till I come, and try to pretend that all the dreadful things that have happened are just part of the play.’
1990	Oh master Conroy, don't upset yourself, dear!’
1990	‘Of course you must come with us, Henry, dear.
1990	‘Because you're an extra man, dear,’ she said.
1990	‘My dear,’ he said to his wife, ‘aren't you going to tell our guests about our new addition to the dining-room?’
1990	‘Very well, dear.’
1990	‘Dear lady, I am but an errand boy in the Foreign Service…’
1990	‘My dear fellow, we spend our time here working on things that shouldn't have been said, but unless they are,’ he added thoughtfully, ‘nobody gets anywhere.
1991	Dear Anne Collins, ten years younger than me, taught early Renaissance painting and was just about my only real friend there.
1991	Dear Charles, I have decided to resign from my post at the School for Italian Studies.
1991	‘Goodbye dear,’ I suddenly said.
1991	‘It's not your fault, dear,’ I said, then I looked up.
1991	All those people coming up to you and saying, ‘Don't worry dear, it'll soon be your turn too,’ or some similar rubbish in that vein.
1991	‘You can't avoid it, dear.’
1991	The immediate result is that alongside a few major clerics such as Runcie and Jenkins, we find that Stalker, Sampson, Anderton, Alderson, Newman, Imbert, Dear, Oxford, and Hermon are national personalities, while a second division of chief officers regularly proclaim on a range of subjects which at other times would lie outside the province of the police.
1991	Dear Walter the art teacher, old-fashioned gallant, shouting ‘bugger’ in class, casting lofty pearls to the in-group of disaffected teenagers.
1991	After the first few devastating out-of-loves, she was warily certain that there would always be another goddess; the old idol became a fond memory, like a photo of a dear friend long absent.
1991	‘A very respectable looking lady, dear,’ she said, ‘wearing a million dollar perfume.’
1991	‘I'm ever so dyslexic, aren't I, dear?
1991	And she got things done: two days after she moved in, the place was ‘positively sanforised, dear,’ said Francis, wall-to-wall carpeting, curtains from Heals', furniture in place, phones installed and busy.
1991	‘Oh, you can have all the blight and disease, dear,’ Francis told her, ‘we'll stick with the sunshine and thrusting buds.
1991	‘Well, dear!’ he said.
1991	‘Mind my rollers, dear!
1991	It's a cocktail, dear.’
1991	‘Oh dear,’ he said, kissing her.
1991	‘Sorry dear,’ said Jay.
1991	Her dear sweet silky head was a breath from Jay's lips, but Jay sensed in her a wild creature that scares easily, and held her tongue, her lips, her sanctified body, in check.
1991	But this is turning into grand opera, dear, rehearsals at La Scala for Götterdämmerung …
1991	If I were you I'd schlepp down to the disco and get yourself some trade, dear, otherwise you'll burst!’
1991	‘That, my dear Lucy, is vanity,’ said Jay.
1991	‘Well, dear,’ said Francis, ‘This one's a real puzzle — no, I'll let you see for yourself.’
1991	‘I thought she'd had a cocktail waitress, dear,’ said Francis.
1991	‘It's a baking tray, dear,’ said Francis.
1991	Two hideous yuppies in tubular stainless steel sipping minimalist cocktails — no olives or fruit salad — God, give my ageing pectorals strength!— and contemplating how much they can borrow to house their sterile fucking, dear.
1991	‘Well it's quite dry, dear!’
1991	Have you really fallen head over etcetera, my dear?
1991	‘I could get used to this bi-annual orgy, Jay dear.
1991	Well, dear, hope she's worth it !
1991	Nearest you'll get to Tina Turner, dear !
1991	Just piss off to a nightclub, dear, come back in the wee small hours.
1991	‘All this and you haven't even got under the duvet with her yet, dear!
1991	By five I am sober and handle the meeting with a superb  professionalism borrowed from Mildred Pierce and Mommie Dearest.
1991	Francis is knocked out and so am I. I seem to be doing more and more advisory art stuff for Lucy's magazine, positively volunteering, my dear, what is happening?
1991	Not you, my dear, with your frankly fabulous soul, and not me, alive alive-o!
1991	Jamie said: ‘Christ, dear!
1991	‘It'll keep me out of the pub, dear,’ said Jay.
1991	I'm kinda intense, my dear, and I don't want to do that to you.
1991	Well, now, my dear, I hadn't thought of that.
1991	my dear Dionne…
1991	‘It's a shame, dear,’ said Francis.
1991	Dear, they were down at the Paradise the other night…looks serious.’
1991	‘Well, dear,’ said Francis, considering, ‘she must be at least— twelve?
1991	‘Only I do find monosyllables wearing, dear!’
1991	‘Darling, Lucy, I'm sorry, darling,’ said Jay, ‘but I'm this bloody dyke, dear, oh dear Lucy, I don't understand.’
1991	As to‘a big one’, dear, what a thing to say to an ageing queen!
1991	I was down the market every day with my shopper, dear, for veg.
1991	But I'm not exactly a chicken any more, dear.
1991	I refuse to sit at home with my needlepoint, dear.
1991	‘Get the lyrics, dear!’
1991	‘I really did think you'd gone, dear,’ he said.
1991	I mean, you've done the prelims, dear, in your own inimitable fashion — roses, champagne, adoration, necking and fumbling.
1991	‘A bit of role playing, my dear,’ she said.
1991	But it's been months, dear!
1991	‘Do you wish to know yes or no, dear Jay?’ said Francis.
1991	‘You could start a trend, dear,’ said Francis.
1991	Oh, the Government hates the queers, dear.
1991	‘I'm tom, dear,’ he said, stretching.
1991	Dapper, dear, Noel Coward.’
1991	‘Only you need to be something more lean and long-legged, my dear.’
1991	Lighten our tone, dear,’ said Francis.
1991	‘Hand ri — yid now, dear Chay, Jamie dahlink, Hi take a nap.
1991	That, my dear, she said, is why you can't look at her.
1991	No one ever understands anyone, dear.
1991	‘You must just forget, dear.
1991	Oh, dear.
1991	And now, she thought in the blessed silence, my dear Jay, what would you like to do?
1991	Dear partner of my bed.’
1990	The first copy he inscribed ‘To my dearest grandmother, with love and gratitude.’
1991	Oh dear.’
1991	‘Oh dear,’ Maggie turned to Luke.
1991	And oh dear!
1990	And Daddy, ‘Of course, dear.
1990	Yes, we get some lovely views from the railway, just as you say, but — oh dear!— the industrial side and the back streets and the mess!
1990	Later, my dear , and he kissed  her quickly, when the landlady's back was turned.
1991	Yet how better to characterise his transformation into a ‘dear little donkey trotting here and there’ with dainty feet?
1991	Romeo and Juliet MacMillan's interpretation of Shakespeare left: Romeo and Juliet's first meeting at the hall; above: 'My heart's dear Love' — Balcony scene (Lesley Collier, Wayne Eagling)
1991	Dear Lads,
1991	A separate, dearer policy would also cover you for job, tax and inheritance disputes.
1992	Dear Readers
1992	Dear Dogs Today
1992	Dear Hagler
1992	Dear Mr Neville,
1983	My Proposition, embracing The House of the Dead, Notes from Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Possessed, Karamazov , and, negatively, by way of relative failure,The Idiot , is that Dostoevsky could only promote his dearest values by creeping up on their blind side: in other words that he had an urge towards crisis and clarity which he could only satisfy by yielding it to the enemy — to the horror of the flogging routine in the ‘Thy kingdom come’ episode in the Dead House at one chronological extreme, and to Ivan Karamazov's showdown with the Religion Swindle at the other.
1983	The broader truth is that Dostoevsky cannot foster any of his dearest values except obliquely, by stealth, by catching them napping.
1983	This is another instance of the novelist promoting his dearest values by stealth.
1983	The thought of Dostoevsky fostering, however stealthily, his dearest values, through Stepan on beauty, as through Shatov on new life, must be entertained in the context of the journalistic piece on Dobrolyubov:
1983	Stepan crystallizes this ‘something’ in Golyadkin and Quixote terms when he tells Mrs Stavrogin ‘You have always despised me; but I will end like a knight faithful to my lady, for your good opinion has always been dearer to me than anything.’
1983	My dear chap, a different path lies before each man and no one of us can tell what road he may chance to follow.’
1991	Dear Mr. Pound, Many thanks for your letter of the other day.
1991	Lucas, ‘My Dear Lad, That will be jolly indeed’, and to J.C.
1991	Squire, ‘Dear Squire, I am very glad to have your quire of poetry…which is in jolly type and on jolly paper….’
1991	Dear L.B: When one has finally done the job and found the mot juste , I dare say violent language usually disappears.
1991	As it is, he slyly suggests that minor artists may look down their noses at major ones and that ‘important’ work may be left to persons of an inferior kennel, like the Russians, the Germans, the Americans, who, poor dears, know no better.
1989	‘If I die abroad in exile, let my body rest in a temporary grave until my mortal remains be transferred to our dear homeland,’ said the Montenegrin President, Branko Kostic, reading the royal will and testament to the crowds in Cetinje Square, who carried flags and portraits of Nicholas and his queen, Milena.
1989	Dearer letters
1989	Mr Kinnock said he was delighted at Mr Prescott's election, adding he was ‘a dear and close friend’.
1989	Market Report: Dearer money jitters as eyes turn to Germany
1989	Even a firm Wall Street opening failed to smother the dearer money jitters.
1989	I suppose it does not matter that this was a policy until lately dear to his heart, and even dearer to his wife's.
1989	Her dearest wish was to live another couple of years and see Neil Kinnock as prime minister.
1989	I must confess, my dear Fanny (his sister), that I found your judgement of him was inadequate; perhaps, too, he may not have been in the mood for playing when you heard him, which is probably often the case; but I was again enchanted by his playing, and I am convinced that if you, and Father too, had heard some of his best things in the way he played them to me, you would say the same.
1989	What a desert, my dear sir, what a desert!’
1989	Did not you hear Miss Rhymer say that it was poems, my dear?’
1989	I always reply, ‘It's the Sixties for you now, dear, so you get out there and make a wally of yourself’— and he has never let me down in that respect, I am glad to say.
1989	His patience exhausted, he called another agent and booked a dearer ticket.
1989	If I was walking down a street and some scaffolding fell on my head I wouldn't say ‘oh dear’.'
1989	King: Then stand not so, dear Wapping, when you speak, All stiff and formal as you were a judge Preparing to send a murderer to the scaffold.
1989	He stiffened the sinews, jutted the jaw, summoned the Baker blood and delivered the ‘once more into the breach dear friends’ soliloquy with fiery passion.
1989	Still, this orgy of food and sex would have suited the dear departed Peter Langan (with whom I worked for four years) very nicely.
1989	Together, dearest Emma, we can rise Above the petty heckling of our foes Tis all hot air, and hot air can be used To hoist aloft the balloon in which we soar!
1989	Ghost: Well, Ken, dear boy, you somewhat asked for it, When you chose Henry V to film again, Drawing inevitable comparisons.
1989	Ghost: Oh, very droll, dear lad — you will go far.
1989	‘He has lost his pension rights and the personal affection of those dear to him and also, when a police officer goes to prison, he often carries an extra load for his misdoings.’
1989	‘Wake yourself up, dear,’ she said, and she hurried on.
1989	‘Pull yourself together, dear,’ she said.
1989	Between July 1988, when it is now known the department knew of at least seven cases, and August 1989, when Geoffrey Dear, the Chief Constable of the West Midlands, purged his CID department — moving 39 serving and former squad officers into administrative roles — at least two more men were convicted on the basis of disputed confession evidence.
1989	Mr Dear has said he did not take earlier action because he was told there was no evidence to suggest a wider conspiracy.
1989	Because none of the men formally lodged complaints, the authority was not told of the three extra cases until after Mr Dear's purge.
1989	‘That's lovely, dear.
1991	Manning lists numerous categories employed in a London subdivision, such as‘old boots’, ‘old dears’, ‘cows’, ‘slags’, ‘greasers’, ‘John Does’, and ‘yobs’(1977: 236–8).
1991	Examples here are typifications of judges (‘hard’, ‘soft’, ‘fair’), solicitors (‘clever’, ‘stupid’), rape victims (‘pure’, ‘asking for it’, ‘good-time girls’), the typification ‘common-law job’ for children born out of wedlock, and ‘old dear’for friendly female pensioners.
1991	Again local knowledge is used, for example, to classify specific pensioners as either ‘old dears’ or ‘old biddies/dolls’, and the categorization is often negotiated between the police concerned on this basis.
1991	‘Dear Mr Ken Ward, I made an order for the survival bag as you kindly indicated.
1991	And yes, you've guessed it — a few weeks later what should I discover among my mail but a letter: ‘Dear Mr Ken Ward, where may I purchase an emergency…
1991	My dear mother, I never were more utterly miserable.
1991	The work dearest to his heart was the development of the Retreat House at Wydale Hall near Scarborough, for which he made money available, encouraged the nuns, Sisters of the Holy Paraclete, who ran it, and was grateful when he saw more and more people go there to say their prayers.
1991	Since I knew that I was to have the privilege of addressing this seminar, I have studied with great textual care the document issued by the federation under the title Dear Fellow Citizen because it appeared to me that it was ‘the brief’ for what I was to say to you.
1987	One of Eliot's great strengths is his continuing sense of humour; even The Waste Land has Mr Eugenides and the pseudo-gentility of Madame Sosostris's ‘dear Mrs. Equitone’.
1990	Dear Son, There is a shilling on the mantelpiece.
1990	‘Observe, dear Lionel, the remarkable framing of the leg and its juxtaposition with the Corinthian column.’
1991	Dear Mr Tatchell When I lived in Bermondsey, until my family were bombed out while I was fighting to protect my country from outside evils, we had a saying, Bermondsey was a place where men were men and women counted as ‘manholes’ and members of the ‘Middlesex Regiment’would not be tolerated.

1989	‘I don't see how you can expect people to follow your lead, to trust you, to commit themselves to the business unless they believe that all of these things are dear to your heart.’
1990	This narrow lane was dear to her.
1990	The wild strawberries, the wiry grasses, the black fruit of the vetches on the banks were all dear presences.
1990	They had worked so hard as children in the fields that each field and tree had become a dear presence, especially the hedges.
1991	It turns on to its side and as I cling on for dear life I hear a startled cry from Nathan.
1991	Through his efforts in this direction he effectively mocks much that is dear to scholars, historians, literary critics and art historians, especially the concept of a clear chronological sequence: his answer to the problem of how a Mexican can ‘belong’ to the dynasty of European art is, as it were, to invade it retrospectively.
1989	Sport was the true province of private persons in private clubs and tampering with this smacked of an authoritarianism foreign to all that Britons — Labour, Liberal, and Tory — held most dear.
1989	Rationality, so dear to the reforming heart, ironically found its fullest expression in the picking of winners after careful perusal of ‘the sporting intelligence’.
1991	‘Yes please, dear.’
1991	‘Just wondered, dear,…’
1969	'Mabel dear, listen here!
1969	Jack heard him whistling, ‘Mabel dear, listen here’ under the stars and then as the shadow was absorbed and lost in the many tree shadows, the whistle too faded and there was no sound but the gentle chatter of the stream, the Kingsbrook that flowed everlastingly over its bed of thin round stones.
1969	Dear old Charlie, he thought sentimentally, the best friend a man ever had.
1969	‘’ Dearest Nora,’’she read aloud, ‘’I am almost well again and think you should come and see me.
1969	‘Not because of your lovely mouth, my dear.
1969	From where he stood Wexford could see roofs, a yellow patch of new thatch on the far left, red tiles some fifty yards from it, then the pinnacled and turreted grey slates so dear to the heart of the Victorian bourgeoisie; next, half lost among the spread arms of a black cedar, the pinned-down tarred fabric that roofed a split-level ranch bungalow.
1969	‘Thank you very much, my dear.
1969	Oh dear, no.’
1969	‘Dear, oh dear,’ said Wexford mildly, ‘and I thought you progressives were dead against capital punishment.’
1969	‘Mabel, dear,
1990	The bog, dear members of the board,may be a bourgeois invention, and perhaps Colin's biodegradable crap is a true anarchist statement, but some of you are finding the stink of revolution too much.’
1986	‘Dear me, when I was a child we went to church twice every Sunday.
1986	You must forgive me, my Dear.
1986	‘My dear fellow!’

1986	‘My dear sister was talking about you only today at tea.
1986	Although I must say it is difficult to find a butcher now who understands how to hang meat, dear me, yes….’
1986	‘My dear chap!’
1986	He kissed Frau Nordern, Erika, and Omi, holding her firmly but gently, and staring into her old eyes, and saying, Do remember our little chat this afternoon, dear sister,’ and she, her eyes moist, like a well refilling after a drought, promised that she would.
1986	‘Thank you, my Dear.’
1986	My dear fellow.
1986	‘Not in this weather, but thank you for the thought, my dear one.
1986	‘A most interesting programme, my Dear, but perhaps a little too much.
1986	‘Oh dear,’ Erika snapped her fingers and caught up with Karl.
1986	Oh dear!
1986	Oh dear me!’
1986	‘Excuse me, my Dear, laughing so.
1986	We had a group photograph with a long time-exposure and a friend of mine, a dear friend, ran from one end of the back line to the other and had his picture twice on the same photograph.
1986	‘I know, my Dear,’ lolling back in the car Karl nodded lazily.
1990	I don't think I ever saw J[ack] work more than half an hour without the cry of ‘Barboys!’—‘Coming, dear!’, down would go the pen, and he would be away perhaps five minutes, perhaps half an hour; possibly to do nothing more important than stand by the kitchen range as scullery maid.

1991	‘We must beware lest unscrupulous people exploit these areas of misunderstanding and divert our attention from the really important task, which is our common defence of the kind of freedoms we hold so dear: the freedoms for which this noble university so proudly stands and for which so many of its sons gave their lives in foreign fields.’

1990	The typical old person is transformed into a patronized welfare recipient, only one step removed from the ‘poor dears’ in nursing homes: not to be listened to very seriously, if at all, ‘not quite whole people, not people like us’.
1990	For twenty years his widowed mother had kept a small shop in a St Helens slum, only accepting an occasional small amount of money and putting off other help with ‘the same naive reply: ‘It's very good of you, dear lad, and I appreciate it, but as long as I can manage it, I shall prefer to have my feet under my own fender.’
1990	There are other less forbidding images: a shipping magnate with ‘a kind face’, or a vicar's wife who ‘used to box dear Grandpapa’ lovingly on the ears because ‘he would sometimes slyly give the servant's elbow a tip when his daily tablespoonful of brandy was being poured out.’
1990	Similarly, a Norfolk farm boy ‘used to spend a lot of time’ with his labouring grandparents: ‘a dear old cupple, and I was very fond of them and they of me, and would never hear anything wrong of me’, although he was already in trouble with the authorities.
1990	Auntie Kate, as they called the old wife, proved ‘a dear old soul, and of course the old boy, he used to tell us all stories about over the sea.’
1990	Oh yes, she was a very very strict old dear.’
1992	It was an easy entry into conversation and, after going through the statistics dear to a teacher's heart (hours per week -twenty-five: pupils in a class — thirty), I asked him about the problems of teaching Spanish here.
1992	‘We must meet reverses boldly, not suffer them to frighten us, my dear.
1991	The fault, dear reader, is not in our leaders, but in our system, that we are underlings.
1989	‘Franca, dear, wouldn't you like to go and lie down,’ came Moxie's voice.
1989	‘It's too late,’ said Moxie, and said to Franca, ‘do go and rest, dear.
1989	Alison said to Franca, ‘I'm going now, dear Franca.’
1989	‘Pat, dear, can't you just decide to give up drink, can't that be part of the new life you're always talking about?
1989	‘And now, Alfred dear, please go.’
1989	She said in a gentle voice, ‘Go now, dear Jack, see you tomorrow.’
1989	Dear me, thought Franca, then perhaps I might be in danger of actually becoming as saintly as I seem!
1989	‘Of course, dear Ludens.
1989	‘No, thanks, Franca, dear, let's just sit down and be quiet together.’
1989	‘Ludens, dear Alfred, old friend, don't get fixated on that man, there's nothing left in him, he's an empty shell.
1989	‘Franca, I can't — Oh dear — I promised Irina I'd go over and help her pack — I said I'd stay all day — they're leaving, you know —’
1989	‘Oh dear, oh dear, I can't , we're supposed to be leaving tomorrow, or the day after, if we can get everything ready, there's so much to do.
1989	‘I don't hate you, dear Alison.’
1989	‘Alison, my dear, don't bother me so.’
1989	Oh, my dear —’ Alison suddenly reached out a long brown arm.
1989	‘Patrick, dear,’ said Franca, ‘Alison and I have decided to run away together.’
1989	We could all live together nearby in different cottages and be dear friends.’
1989	‘No, no, keep it, dear Pat.
1989	‘Oh, Pat, dear!’
1989	Now could you just do me a cup of tea, Irina dear?’
1990	Both began ‘Dear Madam’, and both were unsigned.
1990	Dear Madam,
1990	I know you go out in company very little, and was the more fortunate that dear Crabb managed to entice you to his breakfast table.
1990	Dear Madam,
1990	I know you go out in company very little, and was the more fortunate that dear Crabb managed to entice you to his breakfast table.
1990	I know that you came only to honour dear Crabb, at a small informal party, because he had been of assistance to your illustrious father, and valued his work at a time when it meant a great deal to him.
1990	‘Dear Madam, Since our extraordinary conversation, I have thought of nothing else.’
1990	‘Dear Madam, Since our pleasant and unexpected conversation I have thought of little else.’
1990	Ash had never met Miss LaMotte, who indeed came out exceptionally to please me and to speak of her dear Father, whose Mythologies I have had some hand in bringing before the English public.
1990	I too desired to be at home, and was glad when we were able to close our own dear front door behind us, and be gathered in to the silence of our little parlour.
1990	When I think of my previous existence — of all I thought I could reasonably expect of the rest of my life, an allowed place at the extreme corner of someone's drawing-room carpet, a Servant's garret or no better, I give thanks for every little thing, which is unspeakably dear to me.
1990	And she kissed me, and called me her dear Blanche, and said I knew she was a good girl, and very strong, and not foolish.
1990	‘You should be ashamed to believe that,’ said Fergus, ‘and you so wise and clever about every other thing, my dear.’
1990	And I said — for I was permitted to answer — that I had no desire for marriage, but wished to live unwed and happy with my dear brother and no other.
1990	I said that without my dear brother I had little care where I was, and no one I wished to speak to.
1990	And you may ask yourselves, my dear and most innocent readers, whether he spoke there with more gentleness or cunning, since the lady set such store on giving herself of her own free will, and since also the castle with its gardens, though now measurable with pins and fine stitches and thumbnails and thimbles, were lordly and handsome enough for any man to wish to spend his days there.
1990	George dear, I have had an adventure and been rescued by a knight.
1990	‘We'll bring you back any treasure we find, dear: If you wait.’
1990	Dear Miss LaMotte,
1990	It was a great pleasure to talk to you at dear Crabb's breakfast party.
1990	Dear Mr Ash,
1990	Dear Randolph,
1990	My dear,
1990	‘So you shall, my dear,’ said his wife.
1990	‘Oh dear, are you sure, Alex?
1990	‘Oh dear, where shall I find him then?’
1990	‘Oh dear, you and your girlfriends…well, perhaps Tory could come too?’ she looked enquiringly at Marie, who admitted that Victoria had been considered too young to ride by her parents.
1990	In a clipped, reconstituted Oxford accent he called his colleagues ‘old chap,’ and ‘my dear fellow.’
1990	I can do the work OK, they're giving me really good grades, which is more than my dear dumb sister.
1990	Oh dear.
1990	‘It's a very long way, dear, and bound to be boggy at this time of year.
1990	‘Sister mine, dear, dear sister,’ he said comfortingly, ‘that was a damn-fool thing to do.
1990	Come then, my dear.
1990	And you will, dearest sister Elizabeth, won't you?’
1990	‘Of course, dearest brother John.
1990	‘Thank you, my dear.’
1990	Never let that rub at your heart, my dear.
1990	Poor dear Hugh's face was somehow much less vivid than the tall hennins a married lady could wear, that gave her extra height.
1990	‘He'll be fine in a few days, my dear, with an infusion of clover and foxglove to steady his heart.
1990	Elizabeth, my dear, we'll have to see to that at once.’
1990	Elizabeth, dear, we'll have to see about training a new cook.’
1990	But she will do her duty — won't you, my dear?’
1990	Mother, dear mother, she knew already exactly where she'd start!
1990	‘I pray you remember, dear mother, that it is I who am Lady of Duart.
1990	No, no, my dear!
1990	Dear God, who would ever have thought, looking at the insignificant scrap, that she could affect the world more than a dry leaf?
1990	Dear God!
1990	‘She's no more beautiful than yourself, my dear.
1990	‘What do you want to do, my dear?’
1990	‘A nettle stings if you brush it lightly, dear sister.
1990	You've not hurt your head, have you, my dear?
1990	‘I'm sure you will, my dear!’ he praised her.
1990	I thank you for setting me right, my dear.’
1990	God preserve you, my dear, dear lad.’
1990	There are such men in this city, and even to see them, never mind to touch them or have them kiss you, or see them just before dawn, or to have them as one of your dear friends, is one of the great pleasures of our life, and it is commoner than most people think.
1990	And suddenly we'd all be in Amsterdam or Paris or something like somebody's idea of America for the evening, or else it would still be our own dear city, but from very definitely another era, all striped Regency wallpaper and framed Angus McBean photographs of Vivien Leigh; or another time there'd be nothing but opera on the sound system for a whole week, there'd be complaints of course but Madame would say,I'm just trying to give you boys an education , and Gary at least would be very happy.
1990	Some of the letters were in ballpoint, some in a big fat lazy hand in heavy black ink, only twenty-six words on the page, some typed (some well-typed, some mis-typed); but despite these differences, each letter began with the same phrase:My Dear Boy .
1990	They formed a sequence, dated from 1903 to 1927, detailing the changing fashions of that period —my dear , we never showed our legs like that.
1990	There had been no attempt to make these signatures credible; the words ‘for my Dear and especial Boy, with affectionate regards from Mr Arthur Bloxam’ appeared across a faded nineteenth-century portrait; but they also appeared scrawled lavishly across a portrait of an eighteen-year-old boxer torn from the sports pages of a recent newspaper.
1990	Boy did not keep in this box the letters that arrived once a week at his flat, regularly, on a Tuesday morning, letters which also began ‘Dear Boy’ or ‘My Dear Boy’, but which were all signed ‘Father’.
1990	But even when they were famous names like those, Madame used to recite or whisper them like they were the names of lovers or at least the dear departed, girlfriends, people she had actually met.
1990	One more story about O: he told me (it was as if he was trying to explain the oddity of his lovemaking to me, as if he was trying to account for or apologise for the way he'd treated me, or perhaps to reassure me concerning the effect he'd had on me, I don't know), in the morning he told me that there was one man, this had been just a couple of years previously, there was one man who had summoned him to his bedside to be counted amongst a farewell gathering of lovers, dear friends and great passions.
1990	My Dear Boy,
1990	My Dear Boy, my greatest fear is not that I shall never again touch you, but that when I return I shall no longer be able to hear your voice.
1990	I fear, my dear, that I going deaf…
1990	Dear Boy
1990	Dear Boy, It must be very difficult for you sometimes I expect not having anyone and having to do all the shopping and cooking for yourself I know that when I was working I certainly could not have managed on my own, coming home tired and then making dinner your own dinner and then going upstairs to do some more work, what sort of life is that, though I know all about that because of course I did do that for three years almost, and I know how much happier I was when I knew there was someone waiting for me and having the dinner ready and keeping the house clean and all those things, or perhaps you people don't think those things are important.
1990	Occasionally when she was wearing this she had a trick of lifting it like wings, or ruffling it as if it was her real plumage, and she'd declare: ‘My dears, I am preparing for The Flight — into Egypt, to the islands, to the New World — who knows!’
1989	Mustn't speak ill of our dear allies.’
1991	My dear wife has joined me.
1984	Dear Lord You know that I have not worked as hard as I ought.
1991	Dear Scuba World
1991	Dear Scuba World

1991	Dear Scuba World
1991	Dear Scuba World
1991	Dear Scuba World
1991	Dear Scuba World
1990	You had changed her mourning into joy, a joy much richer than she had wanted and much dearer and purer than she had looked for.
1990	Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you.
1989	Surveys show that even in the most sexually permissive of times, fidelity is a value most of us hold dear.
1989	‘A dear little woman.
1989	There she was lying on the floor with Bonfire of the Vanities under her head and me giving her a gentle kneading — spelt with a ‘k’ dear — and we were getting quite absorbed when all of a sudden the door flew open and in he came.
1989	DEAR MARGE
1990	Time, my dear chap, is of the essence, considering the murderer's identity.’
1990	‘Can't have the world thinking Tweed broke loose at long last, had his way with an attractive girl and then throttled the poor dear…’
1990	‘Oh, no definite proposal, my dear chap.
1991	Dear SB!
1991	Dear sir,
1991	Dear Steve Kane,
1982	Dear Ronnie How are you getting on as you can see at the top I have been put away in a prison.
1985	It is my opinion that the heavy grade mesh with the narrower width (6 inches) between verticals is by far the best value in the long run although considerably dearer in the first instance.
1985	Oh dear.
1985	That's an invasion of privacy, isn't it dear…’
1991	DEAR SPARE RIB,
1991	DEAR SPARE RIB,
1991	DEAR MADAM/SIR,
1991	DEAR SPARE RIB,
1991	DEAR SPARE RIB,
1991	DEAR SPARE RIB,
1991	DEAR SPARE RIB,
1991	It would amount to no more than the patient being dragged around with maximum support, using his unaffected side to try to keep up, and holding on to his helpers for dear life.
1991	‘Ooh, I don't think we should go in there, dear.
1991	The Dear Report on Handsworth captures this image and links it to the social condition of young blacks:
1991	(Dear, 1985, p. 69)
1991	This was an argument put most succinctly by Geoffrey Dear, Chief Constable of the West Midlands (Dear, 1985) and by Douglas Hurd, the Home Secretary, in relation to Handsworth.
1991	Numerous examples of this line of argument can be found in Dear's report on Handsworth, and in press coverage during the riots.
1991	Second, just as Dear's image of a few hundred ‘young black criminals’ was used to explain what happened in Handsworth, the problem of drugs was used to explain what happened at a national level.
1991	The Chief Constable for the West Midlands, Geoffrey Dear, took this argument further by pointing out that the day before the riots a successful carnival had taken place, with the support of local community leaders.
1990	‘All right, dear?
1990	Which I most certainly am not, as nearest and dearest, and gangs of so-called friends will confirm.
1990	‘Now dear, we don't have a gaff or net, so I will show you how to tail a salmon,’ he said, unctuously.
1990	There was ‘in the English constitution an absence of those declarations or definitions of rights so dear to foreign constitutionalists’, but this was a strength rather than a weakness; whereas ‘general rights guaranteed by the constitution may be, and in foreign countries, constantly are, suspended’, the English emphasis on specific remedies protected by legislation and the courts meant that ‘the suspension of the constitution, as far as such a thing can be conceived possible, would mean with us nothing less than a revolution’.
1983	Herbert, who had no colour prejudice but a careful attitude about money, was proud of his reply: ‘My dear sir, this is a legal office, not a money-lending office.’
1983	Now, dear, get your little brain aworking.’
1983	The postcard he wrote to Hanns at the end of the tour reveals John plunged into deepest gloom: ‘My dear — The past weeks have been like an unforgettable nightmare.
1991	Dear Consuela,
1991	Dear Sue: I don't think you're being frank.
1991	Dear Consuela,
1991	Dear Consuela,

1988	‘Do you realise, my dear.’
1988	‘Charles dear,’ said Dimity, ‘it simply can't be done.
1988	But we should need to find a crock of gold, my dear, to provide ourselves with all that.’
1988	‘There's nothing like a cup of tea, dear,’ she said comfortingly, as she filled it.
1988	‘Don't tell me, my dear, if it upsets you.
1988	‘You poor, poor dear!’ cried Miss Fogerty.
1988	‘Keep an eye on the young ones, my dears.
1988	‘Not really, dear, but she won't be over for a little while.
1988	‘Oh dear, I do hate all this fuss — but I suppose it is our duty.’
1988	‘You did indeed, dear,’ said Kathleen, dabbing her mouth with a spotless linen napkin and leaving lipstick as well as jam upon it.
1988	‘Oh, Dorothy my dear, there is a poor dog absolutely stifling to death in a car outside.
1988	‘I'm sorry it upset you so, Dotty dear.
1988	‘Thank you, my dear, but I am quite all right.
1988	‘A dear friend of mine,’ replied Dorothy, ‘and a true animal lover.
1988	‘Come along, my dear.
1988	‘Now, we'll just get this place to rights, and have a quiet evening with our knitting, Agnes dear.’
1988	‘It won't be necessary, Agnes dear,’ said Dorothy, in the firm tones of a headmistress.
1988	‘Then you go over to school, dear,’ said Miss Fogerty, ‘and I'll see to the breakfast things.’
1988	She had had more help and affection from her dear old Agnes than ever Ray and Kathleen had shown her.
1988	‘You can come and help me to carry some pictures, George dear,’ she said to young Curdle, who was skipping about the playground.
1988	‘Such a pity, dear, to see it going to waste.
1988	‘Terribly upsetting, my dear!
1988	It was just lying on its poor back with its legs stuck up and a dreadfully resigned look on its dear face!
1988	AS YOU CAN imagine, the dozen or so habitations, and their inmates, became very dear to me over the years, and gradually took over from reality.
1988	‘I hope all the old dears over there will hold tight to the handrail,’ was his only remark when he was told the news, but he said more to Ruth when he went home at lunch time.
1988	‘Sorry, my dear, sorry,’ said her husband.
1988	‘It's like asking me to part with my heart,’ replied Harold, half-meaning it, ‘but since you ask me, I shall count it an honour, my dear.’
1988	I will keep in touch, Charles dear, and I'll tell Donald you called.’
1988	If my dear father believed in the hereafter, and all the good and intelligent clergymen we have met in our lives do so too, then I am quite confident .’
1988	‘The milkman charges more than that for his homogenised muck, so take the bob, Dotty dear, and we'll all be content.’
1988	‘I have every expectation of seeing the dear man again, in a better world.’
1988	‘Freesias!’ breathed Dimity with rapture, thinking how dreadfully extravagant dear Charles had been, and yet how delicious it was to have such treasures brought to her.
1988	‘You poor dear!
1988	‘Oh dear, I'm sure you're over-tired!
1988	I must go and break it to dear Dimity, and then we must clear up things here, and set off for Thrush Green without delay.’
1988	‘My darling, three-quarters of me grieves for dear old Charles and Dim, just as much as you do.
1988	‘My dear fellow!
1988	‘And how did you find the dear Bishop?’
1988	‘Then shall we try mulberry, dear?’ asked Dimity.
1988	‘I'm afraid there won't be a new house, my dear.’
1988	Oh, Charles dear, this is an honour you so richly deserve.
1988	‘Oh dear, Charles!

1991	The traveller who rides on a local bus can learn a lot: in the mountains of Greece everyone clings on for dear life and makes the sign of the cross at every bend in the road; in the Thar Desert, Rajasthan, a sense of humour is essential, especially when the giggling driver moves the sheltering bus to reveal squatting passengers answering the call of nature, and in South America it helps if you don't mind sitting next to a chicken or sharing the floor with a goat.
1991	Things don't always work out as well as that: ‘Dear Sir,’ wrote a client to a Thomas Cook branch manager in 1965, ‘Will you please cancel travel arrangements made by Mr — for October 3rd as the wedding has been cancelled because he is already married.’
1991	‘My dear fellow…’
1991	‘Oh years, dear fellow, years and years.
1991	Only place to be, dear fellow, only place to be.’
1991	And as for London: ‘The end, my dear fellow, the absolute end.’
1991	‘And you, dear fellow, what brings you to this city?’
1991	Sandison was already getting tired of being addressed as ‘dear fellow’.
1991	‘My dear, dear fellow, if I had a lira for every time I've heard that story…well…’
1991	He would not have bought it had he been by himself but Maidstone assured him it was the right choice —‘Absolutely first rate, dear fellow.’
1991	Dear Stewart,
1991	‘My dear fellow, you could probably find one in every gutter in Naples.’
1991	‘…Look here, I think you're making one basic mistake, dear fellow…’
1991	‘My dear fellow, the churches of course!’
1991	‘My dear fellow, to meet in a bar two days running hardly constitutes a relationship of note.
1991	Dear Stewart,
1991	My dear fellow!’
1991	‘Yes, a letter I received this morning from a dear friend of mine…’
1991	‘…From a dear friend, you say…’
1991	My Dearest Elsie,
1991	Perhaps I am in your thoughts as often as you are in mine dearest Elsie.
1991	My dear Donald,
1990	When she put her head round the door and asked in her usual, conspiratorial manner if he wanted tea, Henry said, ‘Tea would be a delight, my dear!’
1990	Over there, dear!’
1990	‘No dear,’ said Henry.
1990	Dear Mr Farr,
1990	They didn't start ‘Dear Henry’, or ‘My Dear Husband’, but simply began, picking up (as her therapist had taught her) at ‘the moment of rage’.
1990	A pint mug, my dear?
1990	‘Yes, dear!’ said Henry.
1990	For a moment, Henry thought it would be another few thousand words on the subject of his obscene masculinity, but to his surprise he saw it began ‘Dear Elinor…’
1990	Dear ELINOR,
1990	Because you are dear!
1990	‘Nothing, dear!’
1991	We barely had time to exchange a glance — a glance which said despair, courage, delirium — before pointing our noses at infinity and pulling for dear life.
1988	I knew the man, my dear master and a great king, who brought the leopards into the shield of England…
1988	The so-called ‘Loony Left’, much invoked before the general election of June 1987, was in some places responsible if not for vagaries in the total school curriculum, then at least for the expenditure of scarce resources on teachers, and publications, dealing with subjects dear to their hearts, like racism, sexism, and peace-studies, unpopular with government and with many parents.
1983	Nutty leaned across her desk and said, ‘Dear Hoomey, take that grin off your face.
1983	‘So will you, dear.
1983	‘They're what, dear?’
1983	‘No, dear.
1983	Sam dropped his gaze thoughtfully to Midnight's teeth tearing at his grass, and knew that his dear old bike was doomed.
1983	Dear God!…for a moment she thought of Gloria and Seb cosily entwined in the plush seats of the centrally-heated Roxy.
1983	‘Hullo, dears!’
1983	‘Oh, do lend me your anorak, Seb dear,’ Nutty said, and he nobly took it off and handed it over.
1983	Find some clothes, there's a dear.’
1983	I'll see that you have access to our pool whenever you want, my dear, you and your friends.
1983	‘Yes, dear, of course I have.
1990	She finished her ladling and pushed the plate of mutton stew and dumplings towards Agnes; then, the ladle held above the casserole dish, she was about to dip it in again when Agnes said in an offhand manner, ‘What a pity you aren't a widow, Mother, you could have had dear Henry yourself.’

1990	Later that night, drinking champagne at the first night party, he gave me his usual disclaimers; how it was all an illusion, everything was an illusion, all life was an illusion, and how he, Sir Tom, was the master of illusion, but how his dear children were real because they alone could not be spawned from the imagination.

1990	We reached Mandalay and I went straight to the Winchester Mission where dear Willie Garrad looked shocked to see me and said in a scandalised voice, ‘Oh, but you can't possibly stay here’— it was a Brotherhood you see!
1990	We stayed on the train for nearly a week, first being drawn down the track to Myinge where dear Jack Cardew took us into his house while the railway was repaired.
1990	We wondered how Pop was getting on in Mayrnyo without us, but dear Madriya and his wife had stayed to look after him and the soldiers.
1990	While we were in Poona we bought darling Sally because Rachel had become rather afraid of dogs, and while we were there who should turn up one day but dear old Madriya — he had come out of Burma on foot with his wife and daughter — he carried my old sewing machine for some time!

1991	‘Oh, dear…’ she said faintly, unable for the moment to come up with any stronger remark although Miss Needham could probably have  obliged.

1991	You fail to take into consideration subordinates/ customers/clients/your nearest and dearest.
1991	Many women resent being addressed as ‘my dear’, feeling patronised by the sense of ownership and familiarity conveyed through the description.
1991	A more extreme tactic is to start addressing them in similar vein — using ‘my dear’ or something worse back (at a seminar I attended, ‘baby’was suggested…but if it's your boss you're dealing with you may need to decide whether your job's worth it).

1991	When I began to talk about getting a job she said, first, ‘Do you really want one, dear?

1991	‘Don't do that, dear, take my advice, you won't like it.’
1991	‘You look a bit tired, dear,’ Mrs Hobbs said.

1991	‘My dear, you mustn't interfere with other people's arrangements.’
1991	‘Oh, my dear Richard, you are silly.’
1991	Yes, my dear, she mused  affectionately, Signora Villanuova you may well now be — and head of a fashion empire — but every attitude you've ever had came from Nora.
1991	My dear, I could hardly keep my patience.
1991	‘Louise, dear, I've just noticed the time.
1991	‘I would never discourage enthusiasm, no matter how lacking in talent,’ Miss Hatherby continued, ‘but, my dear, I'm afraid you have neither.’
1991	‘My dear Constance, I am not suggesting that you should no longer visit me.
1991	‘Dear Mrs Simpson,’ Constance read:
1991	‘Constance, my dear.
1991	‘My dear child, stop!’ she cried in agitation.
1991	‘Come and see me on Thursday, as usual, my dear,’ Miss Hatherby said as they walked back across the terrace.
1991	‘Neopolitan mosquitoes are man-eaters, my dear; you cannot imagine how disagreeable they are.’
1991	I do so want you to learn, my dear,’ and, turning away, she half whispered, ‘There is so much pleasure, so much pleasure to be gained by the informed.’
1991	She's living in the past, poor dear.’
1991	‘She will, my dear, I promise , but you must give her a chance.
1991	‘My dear,’ she laughed, ‘talk about out of the mouths of babes and sucklings!
1991	‘Can't you see, my dear?
1991	‘I think she would love to work here, my dear Monsieur de Levantiére — absolutely love it!’
1991	Sit down, my dear, I'd like to have a little chat with you.
1991	You have a great opportunity here, my dear, if you care to take it.
1991	‘Oh dear,’ Louise said, unhappily, ‘I did so hope that you two would make a go of it, but with all the rows I don't really know, I'm sure…’
1991	My dear, it is such a rush…’
1991	Talking to her dearest friend about Nicky helped Constance a great deal.
1991	My dear, what discoveries you will make!
1991	‘My dear Ludo, what are you talking about?
1991	It is all very agreeable but please, my dear boy, don't allow yourself to take it seriously.
1991	Dear Mummy, I know how disappointed and unhappy you must feel and I know you think I've behaved badly.
1991	‘So, my dear,’ Gioella said, ‘you have fallen for the charms of the most charming man in Florence.’
1991	You do not know Italian men yet, my dear, but I can tell you they are all — without exception — unbearably vain.
1991	I mean, I adore Florence and the people are delightful but, oh dear, they are so inward-looking.
1991	‘My dear, you look marvellous!’
1991	‘His mother is a princess, my dear.
1991	‘Oh, I'm sure he does, dear.
1988	Oh dear, don't tell me to go to one of those dreary little do-gooding tea groups.
1993	In particular, the Home-Grown Cereals Authority reports exports of wheat 30 per cent were down on the previous harvest — mostly due to dearer prices.
1993	Where he fell down was in failing to deliver on late payment of debt, which cost businesses dear.
1989	This kind of bereavement is not just about an emotional loss such as one experiences with the loss of a parent, however dear, with whom one does not live.
1989	To attribute this to the ageing process per se is as foolish as it is to describe physical disease as ‘your age, my dear’.
1988	Later John Frith, a Cambridge graduate, became not only his collaborator but his dearest friend; but Frith was seized whilst on a visit to England and committed to the Tower.
1988	He called on the puritans, as ‘Dear Brethren’,
1988	He went into retreat and, says Walton, ‘had many conflicts with himself, whether he should return to the painted pleasures of a court-life or betake himself to a study of divinity and enter into Sacred Orders, to which his dear mother had often persuaded him’.
1988	As he lay dying, Herbert handed a little book to one of his attendants and asked him to deliver it to his dear brother Nicholas Ferrar,
1988	I joy, dear mother, when I view
1988	But, dearest Mother, what those miss
1988	Nicholas Ferrar and George Herbert, whose poems he published after his death, had been close friends, writing to each other as ‘Dearest Brother’ ever since they were undergraduates together at Cambridge.
1988	And believe it, dear sister, by this rule you shall be judged in the Last Day.’
1990	‘Oh, dear,’ sighed Alfred.
1990	‘I'm sure you will, my dear,’ replied the badger.
1990	‘Fight fire with fire, my dear.
1990	‘Really, I'm  surprised at you, my dear,’ intoned Simon.
1990	Starvation is the best way, my dear.
1990	Ta, ta, my dear.
1990	‘Oh, dear.’
1990	‘Oh, dear,’ he said, shaking his head slowly.
1990	‘Oh, dear, dear me.’
1990	The boy's mother came to the door and called, ‘Come in now, dear.
1990	‘Of course, my dear.
1990	‘We both shall, my dear,’ added Sylvia.
1990	‘Dear me, yes,’ said the fifth.
1990	Anabelle, my dear, you must try some.
1990	‘Well, my dear,’ said Uncle Alfred when the last guest had gone.
1990	Dear Colleague,
1990	Dear Mr ,
1990	Dear Mrs Davies,
1990	Dear Mr Davis,
1990	Dear Systems Developer:
1990	Dear Communicator,
1990	Dear Mrs Davies,
1990	Dear Colleague
1991	I hear its dear pleading,
1991	I know there are those who would prefer anarchy to hold sway, but what they do is destroy everything about climbing most of us hold dear.
1991	Given half a chance they would ‘retrobolt’(what curious technical names they give to hearsay these days) everything we hold dear.
1986	Both her dear sisters lay there in the basin, cruelly murdered, and cut in pieces.
1992	Current hot tips —Sister Act , which has Whoopi Goldberg hiding out in a nunnery (oh dear) and Encino Man , post-Wayne dumbshow about a neanderthal surf punk with Pauly Shore (see p90).
1992	And she's one of my dearest friends.
1985	Women — like children — tend to be called by their first names where men would not be; and they are also recipients of endearment terms like love, dear, honey, pet, hen and so on.
1985	But if a woman calls a man dear she is normally either older than him or intimate with him.
1985	A man can choose to call any woman dear unless she is directly in authority over him (thus my male  students do not call me dear , though every other male on the planet may do so).
1992	Sadly, Jimmy died in 1989, but all of the achievements owe much to this dear, departed, friend.
1992	Dear Reader,
1989	Oh, dear it's fallen over.
1992	Dear Readers

1992	Dear Anne,
1992	There is also one present very dear to the hearts of my family as we are terrible ‘glove-losers’ and can never find a pair to keep our hands warm.
1992	Dear Readers
1992	DEAR ANNE
1990	Ma Katz could hardly be more of a monster than Daddy Dear, Bruno Bonney.
1992	Those who hold the royal family dear could hardly wait for her downfall.
1992	Surely his dear, departed wife would approve!
1992	DEAR MARGE
1992	That would get back at them for their currency chicanery which cost us so dear.
1992	IT WAS great to see the smile back on actor George Baker's face after the death of his dear wife Sally in the summer.
1992	Meat is cheaper, because the sheep outnumber people, but fruit and veg is dearer.
1992	But the bad news is that beer is dearer — about £2 a pint.
1992	He'd have been better off getting them to help him compose a Dear Marje letter.
1992	Dear Marje, I run a country but can't seem to do anything right.
1992	Dear John, Make way for someone who can.
1992	My wife left me without a word at the end of March, leaving only a Dear John letter on the table.
1992	But millions of battered Britons still face the grim prospect of dearer home loans, more house repossessions, longer dole queues and firm after firm going to the wall.
1992	LUXURY TOUCH: He ordered decorators to coat the walls with an expensive marble-effect finish — about three times dearer than the standard chip paper and emulsion he had chosen earlier.
1992	Docs make ‘going private’ too dear
1992	DEAR PRIME MINISTER
1992	I am privileged to count you as a dear friend.
1992	DEAR DAVID
1992	Being a true professional, she flashed a smile — as Fred hung on for dear life — and admitted it was a pretty paw show.
1988	Is your scalp beginning to burn, dear?’
1988	‘Oh dear,’ Matilda said.
1988	Oh dear, oh dear, I must try to remember that one.’
1988	‘My dear woman, that doesn't make her a genius!
1988	Loping and bleating roughly and blithely shall leap, my dear, my dear,
1988	‘Come along, my dear,’ Miss Honey called back, and Matilda followed her up the path.
1988	‘Sit down, my dear, sit down,’ she said, ‘and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
1988	‘You are so much wiser than.your years, my dear,’ Miss Honey went on, ‘that it quite staggers me.

1992	They also RUB the blunt ends of their cues against the parts that other dears don't reach.
1992	‘Lucy has lost an eye, lost her father and now she faces losing her dearest friends.’
1992	DEARER mortgages loomed last night as the pound slumped to its lowest-ever level on world money markets.
1992	DEARER interest rates loomed last night as Britain's shattered economy took a double walloping.
1992	It would mean more job losses, dearer mortgages and more firms going bust.
1992	BEER is cheapest in Portugal and Thailand, dearest in Canada and Germany.
1992	Still, better keep it up till dear Johnny gets back.
1989	You have a little jewellery, don't you — you bought a Windsor piece…that cost a pretty penny, my dear.
1989	And she said, ‘That's a bomb, dear.
1989	Oh my dear, he doesn't.
1989	I saw it happen once to a dear old woman who went around a group of people, gently offering her book, and everyone signed except one.
1993	Dear God; why do these old men discover they can get new careers lumbering ape-like through rock history.
1993	In the event, a) turns out to be peculiar insofar as this if the fourth time Eszterhas has reworked the basic theme of Jagged Edge (see Betrayed and Music Box ), of an authority figure hero suspecting that one of their nearest and dearest is responsible for appalling crimes.
1993	Oh dear.
1993	However, since you have no doubt spent hours piecing this letter together (must have taken you hours , my dear, to get all those words out)— I'll grudgingly acknowledge its existence.
1993	This, dear reader, is just the tiniest tip of an absolutely enormo iceberg: there's heaps more stuff about the macabre, the theatrical and the perverted; the awkward, the romantic and Suede's ‘extraordinary intensity’; not to mention fairground mirrors and all the other fevered topics of conversation and how Suede are so quintessentially English the term could have been invented for them.
1993	Dear Mr A Collins: I am a taxi driver and have seven Cure albums.
1993	Dear Mr EB Davies.
1993	Public NME , however, were far too busy swigging large amounts of Corona at the swish Mexican eaterie Down Mexico Way with many of our dearest pop-making chums, including JESUS JONES ,VOICE OF THE BEEHIVE ,BILL DRUMMOND and a bespectacled ZODIAC MINDWARP .
1993	This, dear readers, is a prime example of biting NME cartoon satire at the height of punk rock.
1991	‘Would you like a cup of tea, dear?’
1991	In his songs he appears to realise that the dear old Blighty that he glorified has been reduced to a sorry Union Jack T-shirt on a frustrated football supporter.
1991	This wasn't easy either, because she was spooked and was clinging for dear life to the poor kid's hair.
1986	But this was dear old Mr Rabinowitz himself, spruced up, a new suit, who told in a quavering voice how this perfect stranger had come to his aid after the Blackshirts had smashed open his tailor's shop.
1986	‘A mere formality, dear boy.’
1986	‘He doesn't do a damn thing for the good of mankind, but makes one hell of a fat living by buying cheap from one worker and selling the same thing dear to another worker.
1992	Access and freedom-to-roam are issues dear to the heart of most Scots, but it is not just boots and shoes that are involved nowadays, but canoes, windsurfers, paragliders, boats of all kinds, and bikes.
1983	Dear G. E. Rald, We should like to take this opportunity to inform you that on 12th March this year you were seen entering empty handed into the private premises of Ms P. C. Edwards of Convent St.,Folkestone and leaving shortly afterwards with your hands full.
1989	My old, dear and intimate friend Princess Marie Louise, who furnishing the Queen's Dolls' House, asked me some months ago to let twelve poems of mine be copied small to form one volume in the library; and I selected the twelve shortest and simplest and least likely to fatigue the attention of dolls or the illustrious House of Hanover.’
1991	Dear Reeder
1991	No one else will be too pleased, but your dear old Aunty will laugh till she pops her corsets and reward you with mounds of her, ahem, ‘delicious’ home made angel cakes.
1991	Because she smells, dear.
1991	WELL, DEAR, I THINK HE'S JUST A LITTLE POTTY!
1991	NO, DEAR, JUST FLUSH IT LIKE EVERYONE ELSE!

1991	‘That's a bit dear, isn't it?’ said a passer-by .
1988	If causes dear to his heart, such as feminism, even figured at all in the mass-circulation papers, it was to serve as the butt for an endless stream of cheap jokes.

1992	Dear Anne ,
1992	Dear Anne ,
1992	Dear Anne ,
1992	Dear Anne ,
1992	I do feel that it is extremely important to think first what your nearest and dearest would really like before you begin to knit.
1992	I hope you'll like some of them for your own nearest and dearest.
1992	Incredibly, ten minutes after they'd left, we found the naughty little locking device and so, dear reader, for those that have failed to pass the Vibes club criteria test in the past, here it is, the competition eve YOU cannot lose!
1992	Oh dear me.
1992	Oh dear.
1992	Songwise, then, a top album, even if‘Girl Afraid’ and ‘Shakespeare's Sister’are still pretty hopeless (‘Dear NME, how dare you say that ‘Girl Afraid’and ‘Shakespeare's Sister’are still pretty hopeless!!!!
1992	Believe me, dear readers, never before have I been as relieved, as tearfully grateful to get to the 14th song on a 14-song album.
1992	Among their number is a plastic whisk (one blade slightly eggy), something for removing radioactive worm casts from the mechanism of a Sturmey Archer three-speed bicycle gear-change system, and an item my dear departed grandfather left me which is yellow in parts and very old.
1992	Oh dear, I'm totally drawn, erm…(long and thoughtful pause )
1992	OH DEAR.
1992	Oh dear, the press officer seems to have fainted.
1992	The poor, poor dears.
1992	Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear…
1991	She now turned and, gathering up the coat, the blouse and the skirt, and the black hat, she threw them behind the couch, saying, ‘See you tomorrow, my dears;’ then looking at the child, she said, ‘Well now, you're dry, you said,’and, taking her hand, led her across the room and into the original large, stone-floored kitchen, and from there into an equally large pantry.
1991	‘Well, would I talk to anybody else but your dear Constable Fenwick.’
1991	‘Well, what did my dear Constable Fenwick say?’
1991	Dear Annie'll make room for you.’
1991	But Aggie's anger rendering her unable to speak, Ben said, ‘Aye, me dear.
1991	Dear God! she had.
1991	Was he dear to you?’
1991	‘Aye, very dear, and a good man.’
1991	Just a few lines on this page: ‘I am distressed for you, my dear.
1991	Then Aggie turned and looked around her before making her way to an upturned box, saying, ‘Oh, dear God!
1991	‘No, I know you won't, me dear.
1991	She was looking at Aggie now, and Aggie said, ‘Well, there will be holidays, dear, there will be holidays;’ then turning to the Mother Superior, added firmly, ‘she'll have to come on a holiday three times a year, other wise it's no go.’
1991	‘Come, my dear, it will be all right.
1991	But dear! dear!
1991	Quiet, dear.’
1991	It's a sorry day;’ then leaning towards her, she said very quietly now, ‘I'm not blaming you, my dear.
1991	Poor dear Sister Mary has never known joy.
1991	Resist evil, my dear, the evil that men do.
1991	Yes, my dear, you have to go.
1991	‘Dear Millie,
1991	She had already hurt this dear, kind, woman.
1991	It was when tea was over that Mrs Kirkley said to her daughter, ‘Would you like to take Millie round the garden, dear?’
1991	Oh, dear me, dear me.’
1991	‘Oh, dear me!
1991	Dear me!
1992	They were really bad mistakes on my part and they cost us dear.
1992	‘Yes, I know, dearest.
1992	All right, dear John didn't like her going up to the loft, especially when he was out of the house.
1992	‘The change does me good, dear,’ she would explain gently but firmly to anyone who would listen.
1992	Oh dear, I think it's come out again.
1986	This is my very dear friend Alexander.’
1986	Alexander was a tall man with a thin, unsmiling face and black, cold eyes who didn't look as if he could possibly be anybody's very dear friend.
1986	‘Oh dear,’ Irene Charial said.
1986	‘Dear, oh dear.
1986	And, for good measure, on his dear friend Alexander and his captain, Aristotle.
1986	Oh dear.
1986	You will forgive me talking about your nearest and dearest in this fashion.’
1986	‘He is not my nearest and dearest.’
1991	‘Hush, my dear, you don't want your aunt to hear us talk ill about her son.
1991	‘My dear brother  must have guessed I'd come here and tipped them off, but then he wouldn't know I had these.’
1991	Dear Spencer, there is something I think you should see …
1991	‘My dear, Hari, don't you think I've learned anything about human nature from my stay at the prison?’ he said softly.
1991	‘My dear Angharad,’ her mother said sharply, ‘don't you know that's what they all say?
1991	‘I've taken up quite enough of your  time, my dear cousin.’
1991	‘Nothing to say, dear girl, your papa is flat broke, that's all there is to it.’
1991	‘What I suggested earlier might be a solution to all your problems, marriage, my dear, and I know just the man for you.’
1991	‘Think about it, dear girl,’ Spencer said softly, ‘anything is better than disgrace to the family name, don't you think, and between us, you and I could rescue the old family firm?
1991	She patted Emily's shoulder, ‘We all know that our dear Thomas's affairs were not…settled.
1991	Let Spencer help you, my dear, my youngest son always did have a good head for figures.’
1991	‘Come along, Emily, dear,’ Aunt Sophie was at her side, catching her arm, leading her back into the centre of the room where the vicar stood over the coffin, ready to pay his last respects to Thomas Grenfell.
1991	‘My dear Sophie,’ Cummings stepped forward, ‘I don't think you should listen to all this, your eldest son has been tried and convicted of the fraud, that should be enough proof for you that he is guilty.’
1991	Emily covered her eyes, it would be so humiliating, selling everything she held dear, but there was nothing else for it, it would have to be done.
1991	‘My dear Meg, this lady,’ Charles Briant said with dignity, ‘is a boot and shoemaker, she simply wants to be of service to us, to make, like us all, an honest living.’
1991	‘Dear me, no, I'm a permanent fixture here in Swansea, this is my home and this,’ he waved his hand towards the ornate facade of the theatre, ‘this is my domain.’
1991	‘That will be wonderful, my dear.
1991	Emily felt a sudden anger at the way her home was being violated, how could she bear to have the things she'd held dear being haggled over like so much rubbish?
1991	‘You've no reason to worry, I'm not a child and anyway the fare is dear enough for one of us, let alone two.
1991	‘My dear Miss Grenfell, this is a surprise,’ he said jovially.
1991	‘And who, my dear lady, is handling your business interests and why are you here in person on such an unladylike errand?’
1991	‘Hari, you are so clever,’ Meg said warmly, ‘you can see what happiness you've brought dear Charlie, you are a genius.
1991	‘Yes, well, if you feel it's lucky to see all the things you held dear being handled and bought by strangers just to pay off your father's debts, then I suppose you could say I'm lucky.’
1991	‘Wild horses wouldn't have kept me away, my dear Angharad.’
1991	‘I shall be the first one to give in my order to these dear ladies, I shall have three pairs of the best leather boots the house of Grenfell and Morgan can supply.’
1992	‘Apologies, my dear fellow,’ said Mr Singleton, ‘momentarily I failed to appreciate I was talking to an artist.’
1992	‘You should not speak too bluntly of forgery, my dear fellow,’ said Mr Singleton, delicately imbibing more whisky.
1992	‘Oh, me dear gawd,’ gasped the young woman, ‘I've never seen the like of that, it's a gun.’
1992	I have this day received a letter from Dearest Mary about that which has so distressed me, your unbelievable decision to place Allegra in a convent —
1992	‘Never say so, my dear fellow,’ said George.
1992	‘Oh, hello, Joe, nice you've come to see me,’ she said, ‘how's your dear old dad?’
1992	‘Still bringing wages home to me dear old mum,’ said  Joe, who spent the occasional weekend with his parents in their Chatham home and was always there at Christmas.
1992	‘Oh, yer poor young dear,’ said Mrs Beavis, ‘life ain't treatin' you a bit nice.’
1992	‘Dear oh lor',’ said Mrs Beavis, ‘why don't yer just walk down the stairs, Ella, instead of fallin' down them?
1991	‘Oh, dear, is there?
1991	Dear old Uncle Fergus's one successful venture into the art world.
1991	Not even good, apparently, though it's very like him, and dear old Sam — the dog — and Aunt Emily loved it.
1991	He did make the inevitable protest of the recently released prisoner: was he to be hounded wherever he went, just because of the recent trip ‘abroad’, and surely that debt was paid in full and he could be allowed to start again in, of all places, his old home, which he was only visiting in the hope of finding where his parents had moved to; to lose touch with his dear mother was not to be borne; he needed to talk with his parents, to explain things to them, and ask for their forgiveness.
1992	OH dear!
1991	Denis Cannan's Dear Daddy (1976), again, another successful stage comedy, tells of a virtuous middle-aged family man whose life is triumphantly self-organised down to its last petty details — exactly one-third of a bottle of wine at dinner every evening — until the comfortable domestic order he has created in his second marriage turns into an object of irrational despair to those around him; and when his first wife, ruined by alcohol, abruptly re-enters his world, he is forced to accept a share of deferred responsibility for the wreckage of her life.

1992	Dear Mr Hurd:
1992	This is the language of the press release, breathlessly informing us that a speculator whose environmental record is not exactly unblemished and whose monstrous Land's End ‘facilities’ are a blight against all aesthetic considerations, really does care what happens to the dear little flowers that have taken eternity to develop, and the cuddly cliff faces which shake and quiver at the climber's intrusive touch.

1993	Now Lizzy had taken all that her grandmother held dear and dragged it through the dirt.
1989	Jane Austen is less descriptive than either the Gothic novelists or Scott, for although her letters are full of domestic detail and she enjoins her sister, Cassandra, to omit nothing in her account of a house —‘For one's own dear self, one ascertains & remembers everything’— novels are not written for ‘one's own dear self’, and she was not one to inflict what she did not enjoy —‘your descriptions are often more minute than will be liked’, she warns her niece, Anna Austen, an aspiring writer.
1989	Dear madam!

1992	Swamps of wild rush-beds and sloughs' squashy traces, Grounds of rough fallows with thistle and weed, Flats and low vallies of kingcups and daisies, Sweetest of subjects are ye for my reed: Ye commons left free in the rude rags of nature, Ye brown heaths beclothed in furze as ye be, My wild eye in rapture adores every feature, Ye are dear as this heart in my bosom to me.
1992	I would not forsake ye, I would not forsake you for sweetest of scenes: For sweetest of gardens that nature could make me I would not forsake ye, dear valleys and greens: Tho' Nature ne'er dropped ye a cloud-resting mountain, Nor waterfalls tumble their music so free, Had Nature denied ye a bush, tree, or fountain, Ye still had been loved as an Eden by me.

1991	Urry's (1981) discussion of The Anatomy of Capitalist Societies similarly uses a threefold schema — of economy, civil society and state: economy covers the sphere of production, wherein material needs are met; civil society ‘is that site where individual subjects reproduce their material conditions of life’(p. 6); and the state is that apparatus which, as Clark  and Dear (1984) argue, concurrently sustains the sphere of production, by promoting accumulation strategies in a capitalist society, regulates the sphere of consumption in civil society, and, through the propagation of an ideology, welds the two in a social consensus.
1982	The breach with the inherited system lay not in Godoy's policies but in the relegation to impotence of the trained bureaucrats who had been the servants of Charles III; it lay in the scandalous origins and untrammelled nature of his power as the queen's supposed lover and the ‘dearest friend’ of the complaisant Charles IV.
1982	By 1808 the unpopularity of Godoy had spread beyond these circles to embrace all classes and the revolution prophesied in 1798 was turning against the court that supported his power: a monarchy which could disgrace itself and by its foreign policy plunge Spain into inflation, dear bread, commercial depression, and the loss of the American market must be limited by a constitution.

1988	‘But tell me, dear boy, I don't see you as a regular Informer reader?’
1988	‘My dear Fosdyke.

1960	She scooped some underwear off a chair and said,"Sit down, dear.
1960	I noticed that she was very modest in front of me, going through mild contortions putting on her undies beneath her dressing-gown, and once when it fell off, revealing her shabbily but quite decently clad in a mauve rayon slip, she snatched it up with a quick "Sorry dear" .
1960	You don't mind if  I throw you out now, do you, dear?
1960	Standing outside in the gloom of the area she said, quite naturally,"You go ahead, dear, and I'll follow you after a minute or two.
1960	There was a baffled pause, and then James said, in a worried voice,"Jane dear, you're not really ill, are you?
1960	"Hullo, dear, not at the office today?" she said.

0000	You can do things for yourself in the way of diet, exercise, good lifestyle, not smoking and so on  but, a lot of women will need hormone replacement therapy just to replace the hormones that dear old mother nature stop supplying to us at the menopause.
0000	Yeah, if she's got a young family, I mean, nine times out of ten it's her that's got to watch them rather than saying to the husband, oh I'm off to play football dear!

0000	Er,th they must feel that erm  you know, it's getting dearer and dearer and is it, is it all worth it?
0000	I would far rather say, if I had the seven thousand pounds, say to both my daughters there you are dears, there's the seven thousand pounds you decide how much of that you want for your wedding  what is left over you keep, and it would be interesting to find out how much they then spent on their photographers, and on their cake, and the, the wedding cars etcetera.

1993	Oh dear.

1990	I've cut the ropes that bind me to the shore, she thought, and sinking down onto the arm of Meredith's chair she listened, smiling, to one of the pirates confiding that when he was in town he consulted the same dentist as dear Johnny.
1990	‘My dear man,’ said Meredith.
1990	‘My dear boy,’ she heard Meredith say, ‘you're far too sensitive.’

1990	Tink, dear, Tink, are you dying ?’
1991	‘Oh dear, I've just had a thought,’ said Gedanken unhappily.
1989	But the fact was that when it came to practical jokes, he regarded anybody as fair game, from the most fleeting acquaintance to the dearest friend.
1989	He had closed businesses down before, but never so publicly, and the fact that it was a project so dear to his heart wounded even more.
1989	His contemporaries  remember him as ‘Dear Randy’, the epitome of the slick student politician.
1989	Indeed, from the outset, relations with ‘Dear Randy’ had been somewhat strained.
1991	‘Do you like it, my dear?’
1991	I said: ‘You must not cry too much, my dears.

1993	‘I'm so sorry, my dear, but your sweet face has entirely driven from my mind the details of your file.
1993	‘Much more friendly, don't you think, my dear?’

1991	‘My dear Nevton,’ he wrote, ‘you are right to chide me.
1991	The older Colonel beamed about him and Hope tried to execute yet another manoeuvre with Miss D'Arcy — to get her to conspire (silently of course and with the finest subtlety) with him against her guardian so that the two of them could be saying ‘what a dear old gentleman he is’ and use this to draw closer together.
1991	‘But it was only yesterday you were out and…oh dear.’
1991	for Linlithgowshire and younger brother to the Earl of Hopetoun, made his attack: Crump surrendered instantly, taking up Hope's opening words by explaining how  he had met Mr Newton, or was it Wilson?— the honourable gentleman's Factor in Preston, was it, my dear?
1991	Which was it, my dear?— uncertain not so much as to the identity of the town as to the quickest way to introduce his small and attendant wife.

1985	‘Now raise your wings, my dearest friend,’ whispered Slorne, ‘and be proud, for in them you carry the hopes of all of us.
1993	‘It's not fucking lover-boy, dear, now get out of the fucking bath and do as you're told and you won't get hurt.’
1993	I walk into the terminal thinking, Well, at least there isn't that smell of sewage around you sometimes get when you arrive in dear old Embra; I'm not sure I could handle that right now.
1993	‘I know, dear — there is a farm next door to us back on the dear old homestead and Daddy does usually describe himself as a farmer — but I meant that we capitalist parasites would be taking the place of the oxen, not the horny-handed salt-of-the-earth types cracking the whip over them.’
1993	We're on the dear old elevated section of the M4 where lorries are so apt to break down when there's a call for McDunn; he takes the handset, listens and sucks his teeth for a bit, then says, ‘Thank you.’
1993	Dear God, I'm tired…
1992	Take it now, dear child, as a gift.’
1992	Dearest girl, I've told you before, you mustn't let a little bit of fluff spoil your marriage.’
1992	And love is important because you can't live without it, dear child: without love, you only exist.’
1992	Then please do it, Adam dear.’
1992	‘If you think that's best, Adam dear.’
1992	And if you're setting up your own firm, I'm sure your dear father would want me to help you start.
1992	‘Too much to tell you, dear boy,’ said Elinor gaily.
1992	Oh dear.
1992	‘You make it sound quite fun, dear boy.
1992	Stop fretting, dear boy.’
1992	‘Don't worry, dear boy,’ Elinor said over a glass of champagne poured from one of the little bottles.
1992	This old dear, who was to be kept under heavy sedation, clearly didn't know that she was a long-term patient, being treated for depression.
1992	Lean forward a bit, dear — you've pushed your cushion down again.
1992	‘Dear, dear Buzz.
1993	How are you, my dear?’
1993	‘Oh dear, oh dear, I'm so sorry, Mr Tucker.’
1993	‘So soon, Mrs Sutherland?’ and, ‘Oh dear.
1993	Dear me.
1993	‘There, there, my dear, there, there.
1993	There's a dear.
1984	(Even if one as dear as her dear , dear brother, Harry.)
1984	‘Harry, dearest Harry — go on.
1984	Dear Harry.
1984	‘My dear Miss Greene, may I introduce a new, but very fervent admirer…’
1984	(‘…As my dear brother said only last week, evenings spent with actresses…’)
1984	The band played Dear little Jappy Jap Jappy , and The Amorous Goldfish from last year's hit,The Geisha .

1984	Dear Vicky — larger than life (too large for little life…)
1984	‘Oh dear God — I must take your name in vain.
1984	But at once she was warmly sympathetic, giving directions to the cabby, then, clutching my arm: ‘Oh my dear,’ she said, ‘we are both in such trouble.’
1984	(And dear God, I thought, if this show doesn't go on, I shall lose my chance…)
1984	Then, ‘And you, dearest, what shall you do?’
1984	‘Does it worry you, dearest?’
1984	But two evenings later, as I stood in the wings about to go on, she came off stage and, separating from the others, clutching my arm, she whispered, ‘Lily, Lily, dearest — the worst, it is all the worst —’ Her eyes, against the wet white, the rouge, were large, frightened.
1984	Then: ‘No, you dear thing, you may not come too…’
1984	‘And I too, dearest.
1984	Tell me, dearest —‘
1984	Lily, dearest,what will become of me ?
1984	My dear, dear friend.
1984	It is called an only child, my dear…’
1984	Each letter, and how many there seemed now, for she had kept each note, even the hastiest (‘half past two a.m., Dearest, I have been away from you only fifteen minutes and already I am dreaming of my dearest Lily and our next happy meeting!’).
1984	Dearest, I know that when I am away my darling goes out with others.
1984	I wish, dearest, that I was a poet and not just a silly twenty-three-year-old man about town…
1984	I know, dearest, that you could take a holiday this summer — You mentioned it would be possible.
1984	His dear face, the vivacity dimmed but shining with affection, with anxiety to please.
1984	Perhaps I wasn't able to say earlier this evening, when your dear sweet face was looking at me.
1984	I could not say how very , very much I am going to miss my dearest — except that I know she will understand.
1984	I cannot, dearest, do this very often.
1984	‘Dear Colonel, please, the name of your solicitors?
1984	My dear Miss Greene, cases of this nature…’ he rubbed his hands.
1984	I know I should not allow one of my dearest friends to discover so late on of my romantic attachment….
1984	And so goodbye,dear friend of my youth — for now I am no longer the boy you knew, but a man …
1984	He was an elderly bachelor (‘I shall never marry, my dear,’) and also very rich.
1984	They ate by candlelight (‘Electricity, my dear, is so cruel,’ Lionel told Mrs Beeley), and from where she sat throughout the meal she could feel his gaze, steady, as if he took the image of her inwards.
1984	‘And that she gets from your dear self.
1984	You, dear, really must marry soon.
1984	‘But Alice dear, yes — that one.
1984	‘But first, my dear, Nice.
1984	Frankly, dear Lily, I saw too many of them last year…’
1984	‘Good night, my dear…’
1984	‘My dear, oh but yes — pardon, pardon — what shall we say?
1984	‘My dear,’ said Lionel, stifling a yawn, ‘who would want to write three hundred thousand words on a postcard?
1984	Dear, I don't ask very much.
1984	‘No, my dear,no .’
1984	‘Oh dear,’ and he yawned again.
1984	She was dear little thing, not pretty,jolie laide , it is big loss they have…’
1984	Sophie said, ‘Oh my dear.’
1984	And your mother, dear, in Heaven, will understand.’
1984	Only Fräulein, dear Fräulein, with her moon face, her hair in that absent-minded crooked bun, only she could be relied on.
1984	‘Alice, dear, just the very person.
1984	Poor dear Mr Nicolson…’
1984	I was her dear mother's friend…a special relationship….
1984	At the end of one day's shooting, Teodor said to Robert: ‘My dear fellow, you shoot us — soon, yes?’
1984	‘Let me show you, dear, in the atlas…’
1992	Oh, dear me, no.
1992	But don't reprimand yourself too  much, my dear.
1992	‘Or what, Mother dear?
1992	It was not an errand she would enjoy, because she knew the sorrow it would cause, but her specific task in this household was to be the eyes and ears of her dear companion.
1992	In that one respect only she had failed her dear friend.
1992	Oh, dear me, no.’
1992	She needed to live his life with him, if only through the eyes and ears of her dearest friend.
1992	Through him…through you, my dearest friend, I have a purpose in living.’
1992	For a brief moment, she actually thought he would defy the old man, but then her heart sank when he sheepishly replied, ‘Perhaps it would be for the best, dear.’
1992	There you are, my dear.’
1992	‘Oh dear!’ said Meg.
1992	Dear Raoul
1993	‘Dear God Almighty, have pity.
1993	‘Dear God, what's happened?’
1993	‘Language, dear!’
1993	Come along, my dear, we must go home.’
1993	Holding her head high she met his gaze, saying simply, ‘Don't be silly, dear.
1993	‘All on your own, dear?’ she said, when she unlocked the door.
1993	‘Thank you, dear.’
1993	‘If you would, dear, then I can weigh out some packets of tea.
1993	‘Oh dear, more bills from the wholesalers, by  the looks of them.
1993	‘You've gone quite pale, dear.
1993	‘Oh dear, Marcus said we must all try and forget about Tommy.
1993	‘My dearest darling, I don't know whether I should be writing this to you, but I still think of you every day of my life, first thing when I wake up and last thing before I go to sleep.
1993	Wait for me, my dearest darling You are mine and I am yours.
1993	‘Oh dear, it's so unfortunate….’
1993	‘Anyhow,you're looking very nice, my dear.
1993	‘How about a nice cup of tea, dear?’ said Emily, filling the teapot.
1993	‘She's only telling you for your own good, dear,’ Emily interposed.
1993	‘Dear me!’
1993	‘It can't be helped, dear.
1993	Oh dear, I should have realised.
1993	There was a silence, and then Rosie said huskily, ‘Dear God, what a thing to ask.
1993	‘Charmed to be making your acquaintance, dear lady.’
1993	Whatever will the dear lady think of you?
1993	I could do a lot for you, my dear.’
1993	‘Rosie, my dear, could I have a word with you in the kitchen?’
1993	Dear Mr Kleiber, I have been requested by a client to approach you, concerning a matter of business.
1993	‘My dear, you must be in the picture as well.
1993	‘My dear sir, you must not tell me what I do or do not mean.
1993	In fact I happened just to have spent the weekend with a dear friend and was well aware that at some point over the two days she had entertained everyone suspected of being concerned, and not a word of politics was discussed, nor a syllable about supplanting anybody.
0000	‘Oh dear, oh dear!’ said Mrs Lynde.
0000	And we'll keep our dear old Green Gables!
1992	‘Very pretty, my dear.
1992	‘Dear Miss Havisham!’ said one of the ladies lovingly.
1992	‘I don't want to talk too much about my feelings, but — well — I often lie awake at night thinking of you, dear Miss Havisham!’
1992	‘Matthew never comes to see dear Miss Havisham.
1992	The ladies and gentlemen went slowly out of the room, some protesting quietly that they had not seen enough of their dear relation.
1992	Dear old Joe simply could not believe his eyes when he and I entered Miss Havisham's room the next day.
1992	Dear good Joe!
1992	‘Well, I love dear old Joe more than anyone else, but his education and manners could be improved.’
1992	‘My dear friend, if you will allow me to call you that,’ he cried, shaking both my hands, ‘let me congratulate you on your fortune!
1992	‘Don't worry, trust me, my dear friend.
1992	‘My dear Pip,
1992	‘Pip, dear old boy, life is full of so many goodbyes.
1992	And so God bless you, Pip, dear old boy, God bless you!’
1992	I am sorry to say I did not think about dear, good Joe at all.
1992	‘But I want to ask you something, my dear Handel,’ said Herbert, looking serious for once.
1992	‘Dear Joe, how are you?’
1992	‘Pip, dear old boy, you knew her when she was a fine woman…’ and he could say no more.
1992	‘May I, my dear sir?
1992	I never had an hour's happiness with her, but I still thought about her, day and night, and my dearest wish was to marry her.
1992	‘Yes, Pip, dear boy, I've made a gentleman of you!
1992	Dear boy, I kept myself going, you see, through all the hard work, just by thinking of you.
1992	‘All I want is to stand and look at you, dear boy!’ he said.
1992	‘Dear boy, who knows I'm here?
1992	‘My dear Handel,’ he said, ‘if you want to pay back what you owe him, you could always join my company, Clarrikers.
1992	‘Dear boy!’ he said, putting his hand on my shoulder as he sat down heavily in the boat.
1992	‘You don't know what a pleasure it is to me, Pip,’ he said once, ‘to be with my dear boy, in the open air.’
1992	‘I hope so, dear boy.
1992	‘Dear boy,’ he said, ‘you're never late.’
1992	‘Thank you, dear boy.
1992	You've never deserted me, dear boy!’
1992	‘Dear Magwitch, listen to me.
1992	Dear old Joe seemed just the same, but as I got better, he began to remember I was a gentleman, and call me sir again, and when I got up one morning, I discovered he had gone.
1992	‘Dear Biddy,’ I said, ‘you have the best husband in the whole world.’
1992	‘And dear Joe, you have the best wife in the world, and she will make you as happy as even you deserve to be, dear good Joe!’
1992	‘Oh dear old Pip,’ said Joe, ‘God knows we forgive you, if there is anything to forgive!’
1992	‘Dear Pip,’ said Biddy quietly to me after supper, ‘have you quite forgotten her ?
1992	‘My dear Biddy, I can never forget her.
0000	I said, ‘but thank you for warning me, my dear friend.’
0000	We arrived home at last on April 13th, 1702, and I saw my dear wife and children again.
0000	He listened so politely that I perhaps talked a little too much about my dear country.
0000	I had to listen patiently, while he was giving his extraordinary opinions of my dear country.
0000	And so, two months later, although I was very sad to leave, I said goodbye to my dear master and his family, and rowed away from the land of the Houys.
1992	Red-figure turns out to combine the silhouette-principle, dear to vase-decorators for its strength on the curved surface, with the freedom of outline drawing; and this encourages its practitioners to look outside the closed tradition of their craft to the work of painters on flat surfaces (cf. fig. 45, painted perhaps about the time of red-figure's inception).
1993	He was such a dear old thing, although she had heard a rumour about him and Sylvia.
1993	‘It shows, my dear.
1993	‘No, my dear, we have something rather special in store for you.
1993	‘Oh, dear.
1993	‘Oh dear,’ he said.
1993	Secondly, a dear friend of mine has gone wandering off with a person I'm fairly sure is addicted to a very nasty personality altering drug.
1993	‘Dear me, no,’ he said.
1993	‘Oh dear,’ he said flippantly as he caught sight of the Cell, floundering helplessly in the carrying case.
1993	‘My dear boy.’
1993	‘Then, dear fellow, make with the stuff, bring forth a get-up, lay on the gear, give us a decent hit for the love  of Mike, for by Zeus I am surely clucking fit to bust.’
1993	‘You remember him, dear?’
1988	Then a nurse and officer came and said, ‘Come along, dear, we're taking you to another wing.’
1988	There's one kept saying, ‘If there's anything wrong, dear, you know you can always come to me to talk about it.’
1990	The servants did not want to offend their young master, and Mrs Reed could see no fault in her dear boy.
1990	I was busy and happy all that time, relying greatly on the help and encouragement of my dear friend Miss Temple.
1990	‘My dear, don't mention governesses to me!’ cried Lady Ingram, holding a white hand to her forehead.
1990	‘How are you, dear aunt?’
1990	Dear Mrs Reed,
1990	‘Dear aunt,’ I said, ‘don't think about that any more.
1990	‘Goodbye, my dear master!’
1990	Oh, my poor master — once almost my husband — who I had often called ‘my dear Edward’!
1993	For, even in these difficult times, he still holds dear the thought of League football arriving at ‘The Tip’.
1993	Dear God, I must give up drink.

1967	‘Oh, dear,’ said Melanie, suddenly.
1967	‘Dear Mrs Rundle,
1967	Oh, dear.’
1992	Dear James.
1992	Dear friend,
1992	Now, dear Frank, when will our wedding be?’
1992	But Bathsheba, dear mistress, think of your position!
1992	He stole your dear heart away with his lies.
1992	‘Say the words, my dear one, and I won't speak about it any more.
1989	Dear gods, he thought; how much did she see?
1972	ABBERLEY: My dear love, you make yourself sound so old.
1972	Dear God.
1972	MAX: My dear Abberley.
1972	PEG (to Max ): Dear, you can see he is making an effort.
1972	My dear, the time we had — it wasn't what we meant.
1972	MAX: Oh dear, now you're going to get upset.
1972	My dear friends, this is it, yes?
1972	‘Oh dear.
1972	‘Do you need one of your pills, dear?’
1972	I'm sorry, my dear.’
1972	‘My dear Miss Nib,’ he said, hurling himself out of bed and into the bathroom, ‘take a letter.
1972	‘Oh dear,’ I said.
1972	O.K., not, but for Christ's  sake go out and enjoy yourself, my dear.
1972	Oh dear.’
1972	‘I'm going for a walk dear,’ he said, absently.
1972	After a pause, while she knitted and changed to a new ball of wool, she surprisingly said, ‘Oh dear.’
1972	My dear friend.’
1972	‘My dear girl,’ Emily said, worried.
1972	‘Oh dear.

1985	Lawrence and Americans and people who call Jane Austen ‘dear Jane’.’
1985	She had once heard Betty calling Jane Austen ‘dear Jane’.
1985	Dear agony aunt, said Lydia in her head, I have a person staying with me whose presence disinclines me from food.
1985	Dear Lydia, said her head, you are clearly a very neurotic woman.
1985	Lydia thought of her dear ones whirling in their merry dance of death, their faces pale, their bright eyes wild, the tips of their cigarettes gleaming in the tumbling, roaring gloom…
1985	‘Are your parents here, dear?’ she asked in tones that required an answer.
1985	‘Dear, oh, dear,’ said Betty, who naturally had looked.
1990	‘Oh dear — I kept getting caught by people.
1990	Good fun, anyway — but oh dear, people do nobble one, don't they?
1990	His hand closed on hers as it rested on the wheel: ‘Thank you again, my dear, God bless.’
1990	Oh dear what a bother .
1990	When I look back I could weep — dear little things tottering about on beaches.
1990	‘Dearest Helen,’ he began; that was interesting — the letters in the destroyed bundle usually began with ‘Dear’or ‘My dear’.
1990	And then the reply: ‘Dear Peter, I have at last received your letter of March 10th 1965.
1990	Giles said ‘Dear me, what a demanding woman.
1990	Giles said, ‘My dear, we shall suffer together.
1990	‘What a lovely evening, my dear.

1990	Well — goodbye, my dear, he was about to say, so glad I found you.
1990	‘But my dear…’
1990	He said, with deliberate care, ‘But of course, my dear, if you feel we are not coming up to scratch.
1990	‘Oh dear, oh dear,’ said Giles.
1990	‘My dear Helen…’
1990	Oh dear.
1990	I look at him — when I can bear to and frankly if you can persuade him to use a clean T-shirt you'll be doing all of us a favour — I look at him and I remember dear little chubby hands clutching one, and the way their faces used to smell of soap and milk.

1992	Dear me, a high old time of it we all had when Cormac was at Tara.
1992	Dear me, sir, you possess good sense, I see,’ and Calatin looked pleased and slapped Fribble on the back which, as Fribble later pointed out, was rather alarming, because —‘Although he's quite a small giant as giants go,’— Calatin was still twelve feet tall and his hands were like York hams.
1992	‘Dear me, Medoc's got Tara, has he?’ he said.
1992	Dear me, I don't like to think what the end might be.
1992	I should mention the — dear me — the fee,’ he added, lowering his voice to a whisper, as if this was rather an impolite word.
1992	‘Everyone thinks the Amaranth Line was enormously wealthy, but so much of it went in the Sorcery Wars — dear me, I intended no discourtesy, sir.
1992	Calatin sat back in his chair and stared at the three strangers in his house and said, ‘Oh dear, you're not going into the Far Future?’
1992	‘Dear me, I never thought to see such a peculiar thing.’
1992	Dear me, what an excitement.
1992	‘Dear me, yes I should.’
1992	‘It's to be fair shares for all,’ he had said to Cathbad, and Cathbad had at once said, ‘Oh dear me, yes of course.
1992	‘Dear me, is that all?’
1992	He had tried to cry out, but something had smothered his cries, and he had wanted to reach out and clutch on to everything that was dear and familiar and real and safe.
1992	For a  breathspace he saw his own body; he thought that Taliesin and Fribble had carried it to a settle beneath a window, and he wanted to grasp at them, for they had been dear, good friends, and the knowledge that he would never see them again was scarcely to be borne.
1992	There had been a moment when he sat back and looked at her, naked and submissive in the grass, and his heart started to sing and his mind spun into a dazzling vision of what might be…because we can only ever be a might-have-been, my dear love…that little boy with dark mischievous eyes, slender and supple, and Ireland's future Prince…
1992	‘Oh yes, my dear, you are full siblings.
1992	‘Eighteen or so years ago, my dear, you and Grainne were born in this room in the Sun Chamber of Tara.
1992	And then, seeing his expression, ‘Oh, my dearest boy, forgive me-’
1992	‘Oh yes, my dear.’
1992	And then she looked back at the bed and saw the naked longing in his eyes, and something that was better than desire and that was more enduring than passion broke within her, and she moved forward, and said, ‘Oh, my dear love’
1992	And oh Fergus, my dear, lost love, am I doing you so much harm?
1992	‘And since Maeve was your mother, then, my dearest love, Medoc was your father.’
1986	Dear friends!
1967	‘Dear Sir,’ said the letter.
1967	Well, making his room fit to live in was just possibly a better way to go about it than writing him twelve-page letters, as dearest Tessa might in time come to realize.
1967	‘Oh dear…’
1967	‘My dearest, darlingest Bob,’ it began.
1965	‘My dear fellow, did I ever tell you about the way two men and two ladies I once met on Mykonos made love?’
1965	Dear Mr  Conchis, I am much afraid that since the extraordinary …and then it stopped.
1965	‘My dear young man, you are a disaster.

1985	And in the years of glut there is always a slatted wooden tray in some cool, dark attic, which the writer nervously visits from time to time; and yes, oh dear, while he's been hard at work downstairs, up in the attic there are puckering skins, warning spots, a sudden brown collapse and the sprouting of snowflakes.
1985	‘In the depths of my heart I can't help being convinced that my dear fellow-men, with a few exceptions, are worthless.’
1985	‘Well then, Du Camp,’ someone finally suggested with a little impatience, ‘what about our dear Gustave?’
1992	Then a list of possible new schemes dear to committee members' hearts is added and a list of possible economies and cuts, 1 per cent, 5 per cent or 10 per cent in total.
1993	Dear, oh dear.’
1993	Connie held that it was a simple matter to forgive your enemies because, if you had the sense you were born with, you didn't see much of them, whereas with the way society was constituted, you spent most of your time with your nearest and dearest, and the things they could do to annoy you made the whole concept of forgiveness extremely difficult to entertain.
1993	‘You should say, ‘What is it, dearest Mama?’’ said Scarlet, gaily.
1993	Dear Lord, he can be stupid, thought Scarlet, as she saw Camille about to respond with the surprised gratification of a matador to whom the bull has blindly turned his flank.
1993	‘Dear, dear,’ said Constance, ‘You're in a rare good humour.
1993	He frowned and said, ‘You know, dear boy, I think we may have to do what they want.’
1993	‘Dear me, a reckless one,’ said the Robemaker, sounding amused.
1993	‘The — dear me — the actual mating with a fox or a —’
1993	‘But I'll console you, my dear,’ he said and Fenella smiled valiantly and tried to quell the nauseous lifting of her stomach.
1993	Dear me, yes.’
1993	She sent him the sudden grin again and Caspar said, ‘Oh dear me,what optimism,’ but he said it quietly.
1993	‘Oh, dear me,’ he said, standing back from the window and dusting himself down, wiping his face with a handkerchief.
1993	‘Dear, dear me!
1993	Dear me, do you know, Sir, I had no idea this would be so difficult.’
0000	But while her novels of this period —The Languages of Love (1957),The Sycamore Tree ,(1958),The Dear Deceit ,(1960), and The Middlemen (1961)— are in many respects typical products of their generation, they raise a number of issues which it was not possible to articulate within the parameters of the contemporary debate.
0000	It is indicative of the pressure to conform to gender-coded standards that The Dear Deceit , the most serious and most personal of her first four novels, has as its protagonist a lone male suffering from an identity crisis over his patronym.
0000	The Dear Deceit represents a questioning of the causal logic of narrative and the literary heritage which provided both her and her readers with a whole set of ready-made narrative assumptions.
0000	1.3 The Dear Deceit: Truth and Narrative.
0000	In The Dear Deceit (1960) the dichotomy between truth and fiction hinted at in The Sycamore Tree is brought to the fore, and the possibility of reaching a pre-discursive reality is relinquished once and for all.
0000	In many respects The Dear Deceit is a summing up of Brooke-Rose's first two novels.
0000	But narration is seen in The Dear Deceit as the original and persistent obstacle to ‘truth’ because the process of constructing a story inevitably leads to falsification.
0000	This is both the ‘dear deceit’ which goes back centuries and the curse peculiar to modern-day society.
0000	The Dear Deceit explores the consequences of our immersion in this type of fictional convention.
0000	In the 1960s and 1970s Brooke-Rose rediscovered the recycling of our cultural heritage condemned in The Dear Deceit as a form of parodic interrogation.
0000	Though the technique employed in The Dear Deceit represents a laying-bare of traditional narrative devices without offering an alternative approach, it sets the stage for the more radical break with the conventions of realism which Brooke-Rose's fiction demonstrated four years later.
0000	The Languages of Love ,The Sycamore Tree , and The Dear Deceit all portray characters who are defined by their roles as interpreters or carriers of information.
0000	In The Dear Deceit mis-quotation generates an ironic effect of mis-contextualization.

1993	She read about the Battle of Britain; and it wasn't any longer an old man's war, dear to her father's heart, and a cause, in earlier days, of much laughter and secret nods and winks between she and her brother.
1993	She rested her hands gently on his back, massaging the tight, tense muscles of his neck, and said softly: ‘But it's true, my dear.
1993	‘I was just about to ring you , dear, to see if we could pop over for the day, just to say goodbye — but I've been so busy these last few days, what with one thing and another.
1993	‘No, of course not, Cassie dear.
1993	She in no way blamed her dear little house for the terrifying events of the past few weeks.

1989	"Dearest Peter" or "Pete, dearest" or "Pete, my dearest" or "Pete, my darling" or just "Darling Pete" — which to choose?
1989	Marion decided finally that she'd start with "Dearest Pete" and work up gradually to "Pete, my darling" because that seemed to her to be the most loving, the most tender, the most romantic: the one with the sound of real love echoing round the saying of it when it was spoken.
1989	Pete, dearest,
1989	Dear Pete,
1989	Dear Tom, you don't know me, but I'm a friend of Pete's and Sue's, and I wonder whether…
1989	"My dear girl!
1989	"How about you, Anna dear?"
1989	"I hope you're not coming down with a fever, dear," said my mother.
1989	Irena said: "My dear, I think we have discussed this before.
1989	"My dear Alice, the symptoms of love are as clear as those of measles."
1990	Eratosthenes reported with obvious sympathy that Arsinoe III Philopator was hostile to the crowd celebrating one of the Dionysiac festivals dear to her husband Ptolemy IV Philopator (241 F 16 Jacoby).
1985	A dear friend, John.
1985	Very dear."
1985	A dear friend (oh so very dear) had run out on him.
1985	"Yes he's saved also, dear," intervened Fielding, and I said,
1981	"Dear friend" , he wrote  to Rohde in September,"what I learn there, and see, and hear, and understand, is indescribable.
1981	Years before, Nietzsche had written: "the past is dearer to me than the present; but I believe in a better future" .
1988	"Well, dear, if you don't like the smell, let's go aft," said Richard, picking up the tray.
1988	"No, dear, he's gone home."
1988	She began, Dear Sis, Tell Joel that it's quite an education in itself for the girls to be brought up in the heart of the capital, and on the very shores of London's historic river.
1988	You, my dear, you're half in love with your husband, then there's Martha who's half a child and half a girl, Richard who can't give up being half in the Navy, Willis who's half an artist and half a longshoreman, a cat who's half alive and half dead.
1988	Dear Willis — As I am informed by those who ought to know that you have "taken the ground" somewhere near London River, I expect you can tell me the whereabouts of the dear old Fortuna, built 1892, rigged when I last saw her in 1920 as a square foresail brigantine.
1988	Well, it's one of the big sewers, my dear, I'll get the name right for you."
1988	The misunderstanding delighted Tilda,"Dear grandfather, are you sure you are not weary?
1988	Martha smiled at the idea of these dear dead days.
1988	"No, dear, my wife's coming to give me a hand."
1988	"You've never seen her, dear."
1988	"Isn't that an antique shop, dear?"
1988	"They're quite pretty tiles, dear, not anything more than that."
1988	"I'm always careful, dear."
1988	"That's absolutely absurd, Nenna dear."
1988	"You're home, dear.
1988	"What's it mean, Tilda dear?"
1988	"I shall have to take you back with me to Vienna, dear Tilda, yes, I'm sorry, I shan't be able to manage without you, fortunately you're so small they won't miss you here and I can take you for a Glücksbringer."
1988	"What's that, dear?"
1988	"They have to take their chance with wind and tide, my dear, like all of us."
1988	We want you to come and have lunch with us, dear."
1988	"Lunch will be more convenient, dear, but after that we've put the whole of the rest of the day aside to have a thorough discussion of your problems.
1988	"We must try and make time, dear.
1988	But, my dear, we are here to talk about you."
1988	"I am sure you aren't, my dear.
1988	"Are you sure, dear, that she's not" What do you mean, Mrs Woodie?
1988	"Is he your Daddy, dear?"
1988	"Do you remember us, Daddy dear?"
1988	"I think he wants to write something for you, dear," the nurse said to Martha.
1988	"It's no use talking to the ward stall, they're so overworked, poor dears, they can't tell one case from another!"
1988	"Is that right, dear?"
1988	"Who's Maurice, dear?" asked her aunt rather sharply.
1988	"Joel can do that for you, dear."
1988	It was in this way that Maurice, with the two of them clinging on for dear life, put out on the tide.

1993	If the Pentos chairman gets his dearest wish and the net book agreement is abolished, he may just live to regret it.’
1993	Finally this big booming voice said, ‘Hello, my dear, very good of you to come and see me.
1993	If the Pentos chairman gets his dearest wish and the net book agreement is abolished, he may just live to regret it.’
1993	Dear Horace, I think I may be a bit late with this as here in the antipodes, and especially being some way down a circulation list, your column takes some weeks to reach me.
1993	Oh dear .
1993	Oh dear.
1993	Oh dear.
1993	Oh dear.
1993	Oh dear goodness.
1993	Dear Mr .

1993	Oh dear.
1976	‘Oh dear,’ Miss Poraway remarked.
1976	‘Morning, dear!’
1976	He'd easily fix you up, dear.’
1976	‘It's dangerous, a cold when you're your age, dear,’ she said to Miss Trimm.
1976	"About me, dear?"
1976	"Sit down, my dear."
1976	"What woman's that, dear?"
1976	"I'm sure I've asked about your Meals on Wheels, dear, I remember distinctly"
1976	"You're sixty-four, dear, I'm sixty-five.
1976	"I didn't really notice that he said anything about me, dear."
1976	"I am not a passionate man, my dear.
1976	"It's all right, dear."
1976	"Is Stephen all right, dear?"
1976	"Dear Mummy!" his father said all of a sudden in the Queen Victoria, while the waiter was standing there spooning out peas.
1976	Make yourself sandwiches, dears."
1976	"No, leave them, dear," Mrs Blakey said.
1976	"Unless you explain to us, dear," Mrs Blakey began.
1976	"Stephen went off with a carrier-bag, dear."
1976	"Won't you tell us, dear?" she pleaded, but Kate said it wasn't her secret to tell.
1985	dear?"she asked Graham.
1988	Dear one.
1988	As she went she arranged her violets: "Put their feet together, dear, and the flowers will fall into a pretty natural shape," she had been told; not so easy to achieve when neglected violets had such short legs.
1988	Take them this nice scone — and hurry, dear,"she added as Nicandra lingered.
1988	Here dear Anderson had built a retreat for her bantams — there was no man kinder or more trustworthy.
1988	Anderson, kind and dear, would have an answer.
1988	"Did you want something, dear?
1988	The Forsaken Merman came to mind: Come, dear children, let us away, he advised his sad family.
1988	Dada, however, raised every obstacle and objection he could think of to baulk this plan because, as he put it (only to himself), the dear old girl might feel her oats and something unfortunate could happen.
1988	Apart from the happy circumstance of the Dear Old Place staying precariously solvent owing to Aunt Tossie's money, he was quietly and constantly fond of his sister-in-law.
1988	That his daughter should need any brighter prospects than the established background of her name, and her eventual inheritance of the Dear Old Place, was beyond him; while, for the present, two good reliable hunters surely provided all the enjoyment and exercise any girl could ask.
1988	"Roberts here, dear fellow."
1988	"Oh dear, I do wonder.
1988	Dear little thing."
1988	"Ah, dear fellow," she said to Andrew,"pick up my feathers for me would you — I think the room's getting a bit chilly.
1988	Thank you, dear child, how kind,"and she re-coiled the boa's black feathers with appropriate deftness.
1988	But, always kind: "Well, Robert, dear fellow," she crooned when he came back from the bar (where he had bought a third bottle of champagne).
1988	Dada, dear fellow, was happy.
1988	"If you kept away from the bloodstock sales, Dermot, dear fellow…"
1988	It's not long ago, Aunt Tossie thought (or said to Gigi — who was still eking out her parrot's longevity) that we used to be rich, dear bird.
1988	That was the fatal way — sometimes she trembled for her dear one.
1988	"Don't overdo things, dear Robert.
1988	Too late, she had found out a gift for her dear.
1986	"Ah well, I won't pretend to be precisely on fire for you, my dear, like poor Ned over there and one or two others.
1986	"Dear Miss Adeane," and once again she saw that unpleasant gleam of white teeth against his dark face.
1986	"Dear Miss Adeane — that is really much improved."
1986	"Oh John-William dear, do you really think so?"
1986	And indeed when she reached the parish church she received a moment of instant gratification at the sight of her dear friend Lizzie Braithwaite looking far from her best in a regal but positively strident magenta.
1986	But then, dear Lizzie, for all the money — and it was reputed to be in millions — that her late husband had left her, had never known how to dress; nor did any of the tribe of Braithwaites sitting around her, who had clearly chosen whatever had turned out to be the most expensive and put it on their large, angular bodies just anyhow.
1986	Yet Amabel said a very pleasant good morning to his mother, her dear friend Maria, who had been most gratifyingly keen to marry this ecclesiastical son of hers to Gemma.
1986	Particularly those dear, good people at the back who, although asked to attend the service, could not be invited to the reception.
1986	Surely dear Aunt Amabel must agree with that?
1986	Oh dear.
1986	"Dear father, thank you so much," her smile said — for he had loved and cherished her most tenderly, claiming her obedience as his right, his due.
1986	"My dear young lady, why so bitter?
1986	"Oh yes — my dear — I have.
1986	"My dear, it is God's will," Amabel kept on saying because that was the thing her own mother and her dear old nanny — both gone now — had always said to her.
1986	"Oh, a little pale perhaps," murmured Amabel, because paleness seemed essential to the occasion, although with dear nut-brown Gemma it was rather hard to tell.
1986	But John-William had bought so much land at Far Flatley from Colonel Covington-Pym, a whole bank of his river and several fields beyond that there would have been ample room to build Gemma and Tristan a dear little nest.
1986	And the dear, good man had designed Almsmead, in the centre of a green field; had surrounded it with a rose-garden; given her apple trees and a lily-pond; a trellised, covered walk down to the river with its clear, clean water in which she could see smooth pebbles and little silvery fishes instead of the slime and gas bubbles and dead cats one saw — if one had the stomach to look — in Frizingley's canal.
1986	And when her maids had got her dressed and done her hair and she had breakfasted by her tall windows overlooking her manicured rose-garden and a green, daisy-starred meadow, she had nothing to alarm her throughout the day but the possibility of a visit from the formidable Mrs Covington-Pym or the awkwardness, as she took her carriage-exercise, of encountering the wife of her dear friend Mr Adolphus Moon who had made himself so very agreeable.
1986	John-William insisting on having everything just so, Amabel herself taking time and immense delight in her choice of furnishings, living a dozen delightful dramas every day over Aubusson rugs and inlaid cabinets, the recklessness of silk damask on newly plastered walls, the sheer extravagances of crystal and china which Linnet — the dear child — had encouraged her to commit.
1986	"Oh yes, dear."
1986	"Gemma dear, he has a right to be considered and I believe he is a fresh-air man — the Gages and the Bartram-Hyndes have all been brought up to that.
1986	"Gemma my love — oh dear — how can I say this without giving offence?
1986	Yet Gemma had shown no more than a polite interest in Almsmead while Linnet, who was very dear but not Gemma, after all, had positively thrown herself into all the excitements of housebuilding and furnishing, taking to Far Flatley as if she had been born there.
1986	Dear Linnet.
1986	And then we'll just run across the street to Miss Baker's and order some more, so that the dear old thing will not feel left out.
1986	They went, wreathed in love and kisses for their dear Gemma yet tiptoeing slightly as people do when making an escape.
1986	"You will find" all that "very wearisome, my dear," Amabel had murmured, blushing like a girl, on her return from honeymoon.
1986	And when you have a dear little baby to show for it then I expect you will think it worthwhile."
1986	"My dear boy, it is you who are suffering
1993	A higher pound then makes exports dearer and imports cheaper, so that the balance of payments deteriorates.
1989	‘Dear me,’ said Holmes.
1989	‘Hello, my dear,’ he said to his sister, but it seemed to me that his voice was not completely friendly.
1989	‘It's a lovely evening, my dear Watson,’ said a voice I knew well.
1989	‘I am sorry if it seems I have tricked you, my dear Watson.
1989	But, dear me, what's this?
1989	‘Dear me!
1989	He was a dear old gentleman who was very kind to me.
1993	However, as her dearest wish was for Polly to follow her two sisters' example and ‘settle down’, that was not surprising.
1993	‘Nathan, my dear friend, how are you?’ he gushed.
1993	Oh, dear.’
0000	Dear Sir,
0000	But the answer to Mr. Daniel's point is dear.

0000	Jorden v. Money can be distinguished, because there the promisor made it dear that she did not intend to be legally bound, whereas in the cases to which I refer the proper inference was that the promisor did intend to be bound.
1989	‘An angel passing, my dear?’
1989	‘You are cold, my dear?
1989	‘All right, my dear,’ he murmured, ‘we'll have you right as rain in a moment.
1989	In the hope that it might cheer his wife Frere had brought a letter from her dearest friend in Cambridge, who was, of course, as yet unaware of Emilia's condition.
1989	‘Of course, my dear, it is not entirely true.
1989	‘Indeed we do, my dear.’
1989	‘My dear.’
1989	‘My dear, since we first came to this terrible place you are the only person to show me true consideration.’
1989	My dear, he is distraught with anxiety for you.’
1989	‘Oh my dear.’
1989	‘I think, my dear, you have not yet learned what a curse it is to be born woman.
1989	I'd swing for you, my dear.
1989	‘Here's to a successful firing, my dear.’
1989	as if it was the most natural thing in the world he said, ‘God bless you, my dear, I knew all along it would be all right.
1989	‘You're quite right, my dear.
1989	She wanted to press her hand on his, say, ‘My dear, Mr Frere, I beg you to forgive what must appear an intolerable intrusion, but I have reason to believe your present happiness must be short-lived unless…’
1989	‘Emilia, dearest, do you imagine I could abandon you now at the very moment I have longed for?
1989	‘My dear,’ she said, ‘you look a little wan this morning.
1989	‘My dear?’
1989	My dear, one had positively risked an influenza to bring her some good cheer, and to what end?
1989	‘My dear, the woman no longer does even that.
1989	He wanted me out, my dear.
1989	Otherwise, my dear fellow, you will soon be of no use to wife, man nor beast.
1989	‘My dear?’
1989	‘Dear God, Emilia, there is no pleasing you and your family.
1989	Dear God, what had he done that things should come to such a pass as this?
1989	‘My dear,’ he attempted, ‘how good to see you up and about again.’
1989	Dear God, he was beginning to think he would be glad of it.
1993	‘Taheb, my dear, I have a gatekeeper , and this house is within the palace compound.
1991	‘If you like, dear.’
1991	‘Like some tomato sauce, dear?’
1991	She dropped the dear, she had made a mistake there, he was not the sort you called dear.
1991	‘Bring me a cup of tea, dear,’ said Coffin to the waitress as she passed, absently reproducing her own tones.
1982	‘Couldn't say, dear boy, but we do encourage young officers to think creatively.’
1982	‘Oh dear,’ Agnes said brightly.
1982	I imagine you've noticed that our dear prime Minister doesn't exactly go a bundle on us, on any of us?’
1982	She had replied that it still seemed an expensive policy compared with even the dearest of umbrellas, and George had thought about that and said: ‘You can't piss into an umbrella, either.
1982	How is dear Ronald?’
1982	‘Dear me.
1982	She lived day to day, as dear Mina always had — or rather, year to year, on a British Certificate of Identity renewed annually.
1992	How dear Maisie, or Natalia, and certainly Emma, would laugh to see him enslaved by an ankle after their more generous gifts of person yet enslaved he was.
1992	‘My dear Gwendolen,’ he cut in impatiently, disengaging her from his new blazer.
1992	‘My dear Gwendolen,’ he solicitously and hypocritically began, ‘I fear this fellow has upset you.’
1992	‘My dear sir.’
1992	‘My dear Gwendolen.’
1992	She'd be expecting a full report on Pierremont House and the dear little village, so quiet, so tasteful.
1992	‘No, my dear lady, I regret I have not.
1992	‘Bill, dear Bill, you cannot have the heart to kill me.’’
1992	‘Dear Edith, will you forgive me?
1992	‘My dear,’ he said at last to Edith, ‘do you think you might enjoy the rat of your holiday at Broadstairs?’
1992	‘Forgive me, dear lady, but that did not appear to be the case last night.’
1992	‘Dear Thomas and I were on the point of announcing our engagement.
1992	‘Never would I have voted against dear Thomas.
1992	‘Mudfog, Our Town, Cloisterham — in other words, dear, dear Rochester,’ announced Gwendolen, alighting enthusiastically from the London, Chatham and Dover Railway and waving her pink umbrella vigorously.
1992	‘For you, dearest Angelina.
1992	‘Oh come, my dear lady, he died a natural death.’
1992	‘You tell me, my dear.’
1992	‘No, my dear young man,’ she smiled, assuming she had won her point, ‘if you seek a villain, look no further!’
1992	‘No, no, the sun will hurt your complexion, dear madam.
1991	‘Hello, me dear,’ he said affably.
1991	‘Pour out, my dear, would you?’
1992	‘Dear God, do you think I didn't?’
1992	Will you take my place in the family, my dear?
1992	It was my dear friend Henry Clerval.
1992	‘My dear Victor!’ he said.
1992	Suddenly he said: ‘My dear Victor, what is the matter with you?
1992	My dear Victor, I want you to know before you arrive home that an awful thing has happened.
1992	Your dear youngest  brother, William, is dead.
1992	Hurry home, my dear Victor.
1992	And she was almost looking forward to death, because then she would be with William and our dear mother in a place of peace.
1992	My dear friend!’
1992	My dearest Victor, I am so happy to know that you will soon be home.
1992	I returned to our room and lay on the bed next to my dear wife.
1992	So the evil monster had brought unhappiness and death to a dear old man who had never hurt anybody.
1992	‘Dear, oh, dear,’ he drawled with mocking disdain, ‘what am I thinking?
1992	‘Dear, dear, your highness,’ he drawled with no attempt to hide the sarcasm in his voice, ‘did I hit a soft spot?’
1992	‘He's not a carpenter, dear, he's an architect, and a highly respected one at that.
1992	I don't suppose you've got eyes for anyone but dear old Jonathan.’
1992	‘Your perceptions are leading you astray, sister, dear,’ Dana mocked.
1992	‘How does a honeymoon strike you, sister, dear?’
1992	‘Quite right, my dear Claudia.’
1992	Myra is a dear, but she's also a gossip…my reputation will be in shreds by the time I get back.’
1992	‘Oh, dear, what a shame when they were only trying to show their appreciation.’
1992	No, my dear Claudia, I haven't made a mistake; the mistake is Garry's; whoever his new woman is, she can't be as lovely as you are.’
1992	‘That scarf thing does nothing for you, sister, dear,’ she said mockingly.
1992	You should try it sometimes, sister, dear, instead of the boring brown-mouse colour you cling to.’
1992	He gave it me to spend, presumably so he could spend time making love to you, sister, dear,’ Dana said when Claudia asked her that question after Roman had gone to his room.
1992	‘You could be right, sister dear, but a man in his position needs a wife, and I would fit in with him in every way.
1992	‘That's as maybe; we're not a bit alike, sister dear, so your theory falls flat.
1973	Briefly, I need to ask you, my dear Miss Rossignol, if you have had any word within the last year from your great-uncle, Doctor Alan Morris.’
1973	‘You have a very positive standing, my dear young lady,’ said Mr Stanforth patiently, and perhaps a little patronisingly, too, for this was where money entered into the reckoning, and very young concert artists and music teachers with a living to make must surely react to the alluring image.
1973	‘Oh, dear!’ said Charlotte, groping in the depths of her  handbag, ‘I seem to have left my lighter in the dining-room.
1973	‘Will you let him in, dear?’
1973	‘My dear girl, are you sure you're not recalling rather more than happened?
1973	‘My dear, this is frivolous,’ her husband said with frowning disapproval.
1989	And on would come dear old Bill, or whoever was stuck in the Met.
1989	And so my dear, dear sister died.’
1989	‘I have been very lonely without my sister, but a month ago a dear friend asked me to marry him.
1989	‘My dear Holmes!
1989	‘Oh dear.
1989	‘Well, tonight, my dear Watson, I need your help.
1989	My dear Mr Sherlock Holmes,
1989	How can I thank you, dear Mr Holmes?’
1982	To make this dear little fellow
1992	‘Well, I expect he was annoyed, dear,’ she said judiciously.
1992	It was rather your own fault, Folly, dear.
1992	‘Well, that was good, dear.
1992	‘I suppose so, dear.’
1992	‘Of course you do, dear,’ her mother said patiently.
1992	‘My dear, since you will be taking over next week, I think it is about time I explained our system for dealing with our more special customers.
1992	‘A very good question, my dear.
1992	‘Dear Luke,’ she said fondly, and, still standing on the doorstep, plucked at the card.
1990	‘Dear me, Mr Barnett, do you not know?’
1990	Well, dear Rex was either lying or labouring under a misapprehension.
1992	My dear child, Richard Talbot would never have left his widow alone.
1992	My dear, it is a great treat for me to have a girl in the house.
1992	‘That's travelling, my dear.
1992	She paused and then said, ‘Don't pull a face, my dear.’
1992	Aunt Emily said, ‘You are a dear child.
1992	Aunt Emily said, There is no need to be so stiff, my dear.’
1992	‘Daffodils already my dear!
1992	‘My dear, don't get up.
1992	‘Who, my dear?
1992	Should you really, my dear?
1992	No don't get up, my dear, I'm thoroughly toasted now, warm as a new loaf —’
1992	‘I wish you would not walk, my dear.
1992	Do mind the baby, children, oh dear, he always wants to join in and he invariably gets trodden underfoot —’
1992	‘Shall you, my dear, I'm sure I don't like to leave you all on your own, not at first—’
1992	‘You are a miracle, my dear,’ Mrs Chamberlin said.
1992	Dear Miss Abbott, how do I possibly reward you?’
1992	‘My dear, the very thing!
1992	‘Roughly two hens a person, my dear.
1992	My dear, I don't in the least want to hurry you but I think you should go.
1992	‘Hens, my dear?’
1992	Dear Alexandra, I think things are just beginning!’
1992	‘My dear child!’
1992	Aunt Emily said from the doorway in much the same tone, ‘My dear Alexandra!
1992	‘It is my pleasure, dear child.
1992	My dear, you look tired.
1992	Aunt Emily said with real warmth, ‘I am so glad, my dear.
1992	Dear, dear.
1992	‘Ah, my dear,’ he said with great gentleness.
1992	She keeps giving me clothes —; not this dear old awful thing, Mrs McPhee at home made this — and making me practise manners and the piano and I couldn't tell her about last night, I couldn't, I can't disappoint another person, not after my mother —’ and Alexandra put her head down on to the slice of bread on her plate and burst into tears.
1992	‘Eat that, my dear.’
1992	‘You see, my dear, you don't really need advice at all.
1992	Aunt Emily said, ‘If you read it, dear child, it will take away your fear,’ and Alexandra, stubbornly remembering Michael Swinton's saying that she seemed to be working out her own salvation and feeling that the decision to read the journal must be part of that working out, shook her head and sent her needle stabbing in and out of the canvas.
1992	I wish it was yesterday, I wish I was just climbing over the rocks in dear comfortable Mrs McPhee who doesn't mind getting wet and lets me breathe —’
1992	She said, ‘Why George, my dear, I think — I am sure Miss Abbott — but of course only too delighted —’
1992	‘My dear!’
1992	Now, my dear, I don't know about saying shocking things — and I must confess, although the Rector would be horrified to hear me say it, that I should be very tempted to say shocking things at Langley Dene, such very new money my dear, everything so dreadfully bright and shiny — as I was saying, I don't know about saying shocking things, but you are certainly doing them.
1992	Rumour says, my dear, that you actually took tea with Mr Swinton!’
1992	‘My dear, do put him down.
1992	You mustn't let yourself be exploited though he is a dear, aren't you, Jack?
1992	My dear, Meg works as a cleaning woman for Mr Swinton.
1992	‘My dear, I never meant to offend you.
1992	‘My dear!’
1992	‘My dear!
1992	‘Listen, my dear,’ she said to Alexandra, summoned  flushed and impatient from the orchard where she had been settling her new charges in and attempting, as tactfully as possible, to exclude Murphy from the process, ‘Mrs Langley says George is heartened beyond anything by your visit.
1992	‘Dear Aunt Emily, please may I go?
1992	‘Well, my dear?’
1992	Come and pour out for us, my dear.
1992	‘My dear, please —’
1992	Then he turned and said simply to Alexandra, ‘My dear, thank you,’ and was gone.
1992	‘But why, my dear?
1992	‘Dear Aunt Emily.
1992	Michael Swinton looked easily at both of them and said to Alexandra, ‘My dear, you really are holding court.’
1992	‘My dear child, there is no question of it.
1992	‘Dear Mr Swinton,’ she wrote
1992	Aunt Emily said, ‘Look, my dear.’
1992	‘Yes, my dear.
1992	‘There, my dear,’ Aunt Emily said and glanced at the little drawing by her bed.
1992	‘Are you not delighted, my dear?
1992	They will be clamouring for him now, my dear, simply clamouring.’
1992	‘My dear Alexandra’
1992	Don't my dear.
1992	‘I didn't mean to trouble you, dear Aunt Emily.
1992	‘I did, my dear, I did.
1992	The doctor, on his now daily visit, said simply to Alexandra, ‘A matter of time, my dear, a matter of time.’
1992	‘My dear Alexandra —;
1992	He had turned back to help someone else out of the train, but at the sound of her calling, he swung round and stood waiting, his arms outstretched and his face, above that dear and familiar gingery beard, creased with the broadest smile.
1992	‘My dear, you have the best heart!
1992	You see, my dear, we had a little difficulty over which should adorn the top of the tree, the star of  Bethlehem which is of course the only proper thing as well as being the only thing countenanced by the Rector, or an immensely glittering and unsuitable fairy doll someone was so ill-judged as to give to Helen.
1992	So you see, my dear, you are a pleasure in more ways than you know!’
1992	‘My dears, we cannot ask her, we simply cannot, such finery —’
1992	‘Cross purposes, my dear!
1992	I misinterpreted you, my dear.
1982	Oh dear me, no, young lady.
1982	But you know, dear boy, the only possible reason  for taking a job like this is to get away from school or family.’
1982	There are parts of my life, my dear Malcolm, that even you are not privy to.
1982	Oh dear — a melancholy thought.
1982	Oh dear God, Superintendent: don't tell me it was the sherry.’
1982	‘My dear Mr Martins, I beg you to reconsider, to make no hasty decision,’ came the headmaster's voice, raised to a sort of wail that was anything but confidence-creating.
1982	Oh dear, I wonder what Tom told them.’
1993	‘Oh dear,’ I mocked.
1993	‘Most ingenious, my dear Daunbey.
1993	Don't play games with me, dear monk.
1993	‘Above all, what will my dear uncle think if we now return, empty-handed, to report the deaths of Cosmas and Damien?
1993	‘So what does all this make you, Mathilda, my dear?
1993	‘To be perfectly honest, my dear Roger, I don't really know.
1993	‘Do so and dear Uncle will simply laugh and put it down to my youthful impetuosity.
1984	‘So did I, dear boy, so did I,’ said the star lugubriously, and got a good laugh from the cast.
1984	Oh dear.
1984	‘That generation, dear?
1984	‘No publicity, dear…’
1984	Oh dear.
1984	Dear Charles,
1984	‘Poor, dear Micky…
1984	Oh dear.
1993	My dear girl, it's a small fortune!
1993	‘Oh, dear.
1993	‘Oh, dear heaven!’ she whispered.
1993	‘Dear heaven!
1993	‘Dear God!’ he breathed.
1993	‘Oh, dear heaven!
1993	‘Oh, dear!’ he exclaimed, not sounding sorry at all.
1993	‘Dear God!’ he muttered, his fingers fumbling.
1993	‘…my dear brother Rizzi and his engagement to Contessa Katarina Vivarini…’
1992	Dear, precious Emily.
1992	‘Don't worry, my dear Lisa.
1992	But I think, my dear Lisa, if you cast your mind back you'll recall that you made the assumption all by yourself.
1992	‘Is that a threat, my dear Lisa?
1992	I assure you, my dear Lisa, I have an excellent memory.’
1992	Why else, my dear Lisa?
1992	‘And this time, my dear Lisa, make sure they're suitable.’
1992	From your dearest Nina.’
1992	Whoever his dearest Nina was, she must have had a hard time of it!
1992	But, in spite of the genuine excitement that possessed her, she could not quite banish from her mind a picture of that greetings card, signed ‘From your dearest Nina’, that stood propped in one corner of Vass's desk.
1992	Maybe, after all, his ‘dearest Nina’ did not have such a singular place in his life.
1992	His ‘dearest Nina’.
1992	Dear, sweet Emily.
1992	‘Surely, my dear Lisa, you cannot doubt it?’
1992	Nina, my dear Lisa, as you ought to have guessed…is not my girlfriend.
1992	‘My dear Maude…’
1992	‘But, my dear Ranulf, that too causes a problem.
1992	‘My dear de Craon, my troops are all over it.’
1979	‘Naturally, Mother dear,’ said Margaret sweetly.
1979	Bill Clough was a small grocer, with a nice little shop in a working-class area, where he had managed to survive the competition from the big chains by being convenient, not  outrageously dear, and usually cheerful.
1979	Without waiting for a reply, she put her head into the room and said in that all-things-bright-and-beautiful voice she reserved for her mother-in-law, which Greg found grating even on first acquaintance: ‘I've got a lovely surprise for you, Mother dear.
1979	Two days later Greg was forced to attend the funeral of a dear aunt.
1979	The first of those from Viola was addressed in fact to ‘Dear Walter and Hilda’, but it was not difficult to guess that it was intended primarily for Walter's eyes.
1979	Dear Hilda,
1979	Or perhaps the two old dears together.
1979	‘Once more into the breach, dear friends.’
1986	Tell you what, you dear folks.
1986	‘Tom, dear, by the time I've asked you to pass something, and you've said what and where is it and didn't I mean the other one, I can get this oven done and the baby born I should think.’
1986	‘Well, no dear, I don't think I would mistake you for a stook of corn.
1986	‘I wouldn't have thought you'd want to go all down there again, dear, haven't you had enough walking for one day?
1986	‘Never mind, Tiddy dear, was you fwighted den?’ she said to the dog.
1986	Dear Dr Jane, Tuesday.
1986	Dear Dr Miller, Wednesday.
1986	I still think of him, though I lost him before we was fifty — that's more than thirty years ago now dear.
1986	Another said mournfully, ‘Don't you let them impose on you, dear.
1993	‘Oh dear…’
1993	Oh, dear!
1993	Frankly, if I weren't in such a high-risk position, I'd want someone a little more cosy as my obstetrician, but Owen is the best for someone like me and at times he can be a dear, so I shouldn't complain…
1993	‘Oh, dear, how terrible!
1993	‘My dear girl, he's one of the best architects in Brisbane, and he hasn't reached the top yet.
1993	‘Sit up slowly, dear,’ Sister Farrer was saying, and Belinda obeyed.
1993	‘It was Faye, dear, silly Faye, with her ridiculous attempt to doll you up into the sort of woman she thought I'd want.
1993	Dear God, why should she still find him so disturbing after all he had done to her?
1993	Dear God, was this anticipation or apprehension, and why should she feel either?
1991	My dear Mrs Goreng, I felt like saying, you would have been surprised to come across a hotelier who'd read Thomas Mann.
1991	The queen in me, would have been poor, dear, dead Maria's acerbic comment.
1991	‘And you must be patient a little longer, my dear Adolph.
1991	Dear Adolph,
1991	Without the Colonel I might never have got through; they preferred you to leave someone dear behind.
1986	and utters German baby words to the dear Princess,
1986	— dear Stockmar!
1989	‘Dear God!’ cried Mrs Wood, ‘an old devil sitting by the fire!
1989	‘My dear Dawkins,’ he said, ‘You will think this is very strange.
1989	It's a joke, my dear Teesdale.
1989	‘Dear God,’ he prayed, ‘keep us safe this night.’
1989	Then with luck I'll see my dear wife before midnight.’
1989	‘Oh dear.
1989	I thought about my dear wife, and for a short time I felt better.
1989	‘You fell, dear,’ she said.
1989	So of course he called me, my dearest.
1989	Dear God!
1989	‘Anyway, dear,’ said his wife, ‘you're so busy, with the house and the garden and the farm.
1991	The reason he asked me out, dear Leo, was because he had overheard some of the girls from the agency talking about the money Aunt Jane left me — wasn't it wonderful?
1991	‘Dear God, Hilary,’ he gasped on a swiftly indrawn breath, ‘don't do that.’
1991	Neither, hopefully, will my dear brother.
1991	‘Oh, dear God,’ she whispered.
1991	Dear God, but he'd been angry.
1991	‘Verlander, my dear Hilary.
1991	‘Because, my dear Hilary, he owes me some money.’
1991	‘My dear girl, you could never in your life look like an old hag, and you seem to forget that so far I've never seen you at your best.
1991	‘Dear God, how I love you!’
1990	I mean, ‘Cripes, dear, if it was anonymity you'd wanted you should have gone into the family tailoring  business,’ I hear you say, with some justification.
1990	Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.’
1990	Frankly, my dear, I didn't give a damn!
1990	This was less to do with Olivier's plunging rousingly into ‘Once more into the breach, dear friends’ than with his own attempts to plunge ‘Once more into the bra straps, dear friend’.
1990	Ricci, that's bleeding horses — I've never even seen a horse, dear, except with a policeman underneath or on My Friend Flicka, and I don't care WHAT they wear at the wretched Olympics.’
1990	‘Now look, as my secretary has told you just the six times, I am totally booked for 1990 and I can't possibly…oh dear…
1990	The reply comes zooming down the phone: ‘Of course, dear, we'll understand — don't think another thought about it — we're just looking forward to seeing you, and we'll be in touch nearer the time, dear…’
1990	Once in the marquee I spotted good old Barry Norman, dear Michael Denison and others.
1990	First of all, my dearest man friend died of cancer, aged forty-two.
1990	On two occasions we were called into the hospital in the wee small hours, expecting the end — but the dear old rogue had nine lives and, at seventy-nine, he seemed to be negotiating for another two.
1990	It read: ‘Dear Moishe, Your teeth are at Maureen's.
1990	‘Hello, operator, I'm trying to get through to the Kosher butcher — it's on the blink and I've people coming for dinner Friday — Oh, thank you, dear.
1990	Yes! fine thank you, dear, and yours?
1990	I collected more useful bits of linking dialogue from Reggie, from Ma and Pa and from her brother Tommy and her dearest friend Virginia Graham.
1990	One evening he turned a small chair over on its side and said ‘While I'm gone, Geraldine, dear, could you work on turning this chair into a forest?’
1990	‘Imagine you're squeezing a penny between your cheeks, dear,’ he would burr in his soft Scots voice, and I can assure you he wasn't referring to the cheeks of my face.
1990	‘Sorry dear,’ I concluded, ‘but Piaf she 'ain't.’
1990	On our way home via New York, some ‘dear’ friends (as in generous), fixed us a stretch limo to take us to the airport.
1993	All the time the dear water like progress under the prow.
1993	Ever since coming upon Rousseau's writings so long ago, I have tried to live with my dear wife above the glaciers in the condition he would have approved, that of the Noble Savage — in defiance of those citified creatures who multiply in the valleys far below.
1993	That dear silver dish in the sky is like an eye, guarding me.
1993	Dear Harold.
1993	Dear Harold.
1993	‘I hope you don't mind, Harold dear.’
1993	‘But are you all right, my dear, after your long journey?
1993	‘Let's have our tea, dear,’ he said, with a show of patience.
1993	‘Let's go to bed, my dear,’ Alice said.
1993	‘OK, dear, fine, great, now, if you don't mind, I want to pop into Felicity's room and just say goodnight to her.
1993	‘No, dear, it's OK,’ he said, reassuringly, although he never used the word ‘OK’.
1993	‘Now, Alice, dear, don't get worked up, it's just a little hospitality.
1993	‘Don't come out, dear, you'll catch your death of cold.
1993	‘Worship, Alice, do de female stuff, dear!
1991	My Dear Theo,
1991	Charles joins me in wishing you a perfect holiday, dearest Theo,
1991	Dear people.
1991	Can I come in, dear?’
1991	‘It's me, dear.
1991	‘I don't suppose Hereward dug the pit specially to catch you in, dear,’ said Deaconess Tilley.
1991	‘All right for food are you, dear, or shall I pop round the shop for you?’
1991	‘Well, I'll have to love you and leave you now, dear.’
1991	‘Oh dear’, said Theodora, as she gazed after the familiar vehicle.
1991	‘My dear girl!
1991	‘My dear girl, it would be so kind of you, but I hardly like to trouble you.’
1991	The Archdeacon had said, ‘Oh dear’ a number of times and driven off, refusing Miss Tilley's offer of a bite of hot-pot.
1991	‘Theo, my dear girl, your country sojourn has made you hoydenish.
1991	‘My dear, such a time.’
1991	‘Your dear father.’
1991	‘My dear, I've known Gilbert Racy for thirty years.
1991	She was desperately lonely, poor dear.’
1983	‘My dear chap, right on time!
1983	Please see to it, my dear — before they go beyond your power, perhaps?’
1982	‘It's not your day, is it, dear?’
1982	It gave her a comfortable glow to think of the church and the life that went on around it, dear and familiar and with the same basic pattern everywhere.
1982	Oh dear,’ Sophia looked depressed, ‘perhaps it isn't so splendid after all.
1982	‘You've met her, dear,’ said Sophia.
1982	Ah, my dear,’ she said, seeing Sophia at the front door, ‘Here we are, you see, safe and sound.’
1982	‘Yes, my dear.
1982	‘Oh dear,’ said Ianthe.
1982	‘Oh no, dear,’ Miss Grimes laughed.
1982	‘So I can see, dear.
1982	‘Oh, it is good of you, dear, it really is.’
1982	‘Ah, my dear,’ said the languid voice.
1982	‘My dear, this is a fashionable London parish, so called,’ said Randolph.
1982	‘No, dear, you must be mistaken,’ said Bertha in a pained tone.
1982	‘Let me give you some more mutton, my dear.’
1982	‘You aren't a great meat-eater, are you, dear,’ said Bertha, ‘so the approach of Lent won't be so much of a hardship for you.’
1982	‘Oh dear,’ Ianthe heard herself saying, feebly, she felt, but it was difficult to know how best to express her sympathy.
1982	‘My dear, you look wretched,’ she said.
1982	And how are you, my dear?’
1982	‘Oh dear,’ Penelope murmured.
1982	Look, dear,’ she opened her capacious shopping bag and invited Sophia to peer into its depths.
1993	Dear God!
1993	Dear heavens!
1993	‘Oh, dear lord, what's happened to my vocal cords?’
1993	Oh, dear God, the chairman himself!
1993	Dear God — not the same scenario of shame and perversion!
1993	Oh, dear God!
1993	Oh, dear God, this was more than she could bear!
1993	Oh, dear God — don't say it's anything to do with Svend and Suzie!’
1993	Oh, dear lord, how she wished she were.
1993	‘Oh, dear, and I was thinking you'd brought them specially for me.
1993	‘Oh, dear,’ Luke grinned.
1993	‘The dear man knows that I collect swans,’ she explained to Merrill and Richard, ‘and he left it on the hall table with my name on a label around its neck.
1993	‘Then break it, my dear,’ he said sweepingly as they reached Luke's car.
1993	Dear lord, what was she doing?
1993	‘Well, in this day and age that approach does at least have the benefit of novelty, I'll grant you that, Shannon, my dear.’
1993	‘My dear Shannon, for someone so pitifully characterless, you really have had the most fascinating life.’
1993	And what's it like knowing your dear daddy died in a shoot-out?
1992	A business letter, for example, will usually contain your address, the recipients address, the date, dear sir, yours faithfully and possible the words ‘with reference to …
1992	Most incredible, my dear Watson!
1992	Dear John,
1990	One subject is obviously dear to Schofield's heart — the captaincy of Great Britain and Leeds.
1990	ARSENAL fan Paul Dear has vowed he will never again set foot inside Highbury after losing a court battle against the club.
1990	We recently revealed how Dear, a 37-year-old sales manager from Stevenage, claimed a refund of the £1,500 he spent on an Arsenal Bond.
1990	Mr Dear's claim was thrown out out by Cler-kenwell County Court on Friday.
1990	THE incredible saga of our dear Royal Family gets more bizarre by the minute.
1993	Dear Mr Peaford,
1993	Dear Emma,

1992	Will and Deirdre came to supper recently — poor dears it was an uninspired meal but their visit cheered me immeasurably…
1992	Dear
1992	Did not get the  job — dear , former [xx]Manager, drove me up there (6 miles north of Perth) and then on to Dunkeld where he insisted on giving me lunch — he had originally thought of taking me to Gleneagles, but I had to get back to the outplacement people — and did so, only to find ‘my’ counsellor had, for the third time, failed to keep an appointment with me.
1992	Dearest
1992	I have to decide whether to put in my poems and short stories and a series of LETTERS, originally called LETTERS TO x (some 180 very short letters written in three days in  about two years ago) rather in the writing style of the legendary DEAR ABBIE written in the 1920s (or 30s? you are bound to know!) by Dane Chandos.
1992	Dear
1993	‘Which book is it, dear?’
1993	‘Come on dear!
1993	‘Up and at ‘em, dear!’
1993	‘You can't just have that for breakfast, dear.’
1993	‘Sit your self down and have a nice cup of tea, dear.’
1988	What's that, my dear?
1988	’ That would be very nice, my dear.’
1988	’ Oh, dear, Mr. Kopek,’she said, immediately realising my predicament.
1988	He insisted on trying to go it alone and lurched against the bannister where he hung on for dear life.
1988	Oh dear, I thought, feeling very sorry for myself, and I'm not even a drinking man.
1990	‘You are all right, are you, dear?

1991	Oh, dear, I'm sorry about this.
1991	So you're expected to give your sweets to your older brother, dear oh dear.
1991	In previous years I haven't had a class on the  and I thought I had one this year as an experiment  and er, pardon me just a second   hello  yes, that was a little annoying to say the least, cos those students have come in specially for that, yeah,yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  right  Oh dear  right  certainly not  well, would it be easier to show them in my office, that's seven, seven, seven?
1993	Have a nice day at the office, dear.
1984	Oh yes they've built oh dear dear, they've built houses and houses I don't know Rhos-y-Bol today.
1984	Oh dear dear it was worse than I c anything I can think of.
1984	He was a dear father and he had two sons, doctors.
1988	But the following Thursday Mrs  said, Well I'm very sorry my dear, I can't accept your butter because last week's lot didn't keep.
1988	Th they they demanded a higher wage er for erm just because Er m a man wasn't too dear if it was a good er harvesting day, a man wasn't too dear at any price.
1984	And some aero aero aeroplane erm g er  er what er I think they were If I remember rightly, they were the  er Oh dear.
1984	Oh dear, never mind.

0000	Dear me.
0000	.Dear me.
1984	Oh, he said, if we had carried on it would have been dear for somebody.
1984	If things were dear, not by so much.
1993	‘My dear child…’ she began hesitantly.
1993	‘You do not have to stay in to be with me, Jenna, dear,’ she said softly.
1993	‘It is your colouring, dear.
1993	I'm doubly grateful that you spent the time with me, Jenna, dear, when you were probably pining to get back to your fiancé.’
1993	That is how she was able to leave such a large amount of cash to you, my dear.’
1993	‘Oh, dear God, Dr Neil.
1993	In his temporary absence, Miss Mates refreshed Sally-Anne's cup again, said gently to her, ‘Do not mind Dr Neil's manner, my dear.
1993	‘Have a bit of a doze, my dear.
1993	He is a saint, is he not, Norton, and Matey, my dear?
1993	Balancing the tray, to which Mrs Darrell had kindly added the plate containing those cream cakes which she had not managed to devour, she heard her say to Dr Neil, ‘You really ought to go into society again, my dear.
1993	I am truly sorry, my dear cousin, but the girl is new, not yet trained.’
1993	‘Oh, dear,’ said McAllister tragically.
1993	Oh, dear, thought Sally-Anne, there I go again.
1993	He had invited her to join the ladies' sewing circle, and even suggested that she might like to attend the Tuesday evening Bible readings which he ran — he was sure that ‘dear Miss Mates’ would release her for the hour and a half the readings usually took.
1993	‘Ah, but I am not a pretty young skivvy,’ said Dr Neil wickedly, ‘and dear Mr Sands does not wish to see me walk through the door.
1993	A look of relief passed over his own face when, the dreadful malaise gone, she croaked at him, ‘Oh, dear, what happened?’
1993	Sally-Anne did not know of this conversation, of course, and by the next day she was her usual bouncing, energetic self, and it being Monday not only was it wash-day — oh, dear — but summer cleaning also began again, with everything being put back, and the whole place was shining and sweet-smelling, so that , Wednesday having come round, McAllister had sunk down into Dr Neil's big armchair with a great, ‘Phew, I'm glad that's all over!’ amusing Matey, whose soft spot for the girl who seemed to be making Dr Neil more reconciled to his lot grew greater every day.
1993	‘Delightful, my dear.
1993	Not to thank you, I mean — and Rose — oh, dear…’ and her face crumpled, but the steely resolution which lay beneath her outward charm prevented her from giving way to the hysterics which she knew would take her over if she allowed herself to show any weakness.
1993	‘Oh, dear,’ she wailed, ‘he must want his bag urgently to send for Eddie,’and then, irrelevantly, ‘Why aren't you at work, Rose?’
1993	She clutched the doll to her heart, and told herself to think of poor dead Effie whose fate had been so much worse than her own, and that should teach her to count her blessings as her dear aunt Nella had always said.
1993	Dear God, McAllister, I shan't hurt you.
1993	Sally-Anne Tunstall, beloved daughter of Senator Jared Tunstall, arguably the richest man in the USA, and his dear wife Mary, niece of Orrin Tunstall, the American ambassador, society beauty, heiress, spoiled child of fortune, who had once thought that the world was her ball to play with, sat on her bed in an East End attic, dressed in her skivvy's clothing, grieving because she could not consummate her love for a poor doctor who had renounced the world over which she had once reigned.
1993	‘Now, my dear,’ he said, ‘no need to take on so; you are young.
1993	But she responded to the kind note in his voice when he said, ‘Now, my dear, you are a clever girl and a brave one.
1993	‘My dearest Honoria,’ it began, and then went on to enquire lovingly after her and the children.
1993	I am really impatient with you, my dearest.
1993	Think how dear Matey will grieve!’
1993	Sally-Anne had a flash of memory of him just before their abortive lovemaking, remembered how dear she had felt him, so dear that she no longer saw his scarred face, but only Dr Neil, whom she loved.
1993	‘Oh, forgive me, my dear love,’ he said at last.
1993	It is McAllister who is dear to me, not Sally-Anne.
1993	‘Try to keep me away,’ he had whispered, ‘although it is exquisite torture for me these days, my dear McAllister, to have you so near, and be unable to stroke every bit of your delectable body.
1993	‘Dear God,’ said her father.
1993	You were right to break with him if you decided that you had made a mistake in accepting him, but oh, my dear, your uncle Orrin tells me that he dare not inform your father of the dreadful things Havvie is hinting about you for fear of what he might do to Havvie.
1993	Neil Cochrane, holding the book in his hands, could not even weep over it; he was beyond tears, his hand on the page on which his dearest love, whom he had sent away from him with scorn and mockery, had told of her love for him, and the hope and joy which he had given her.
1993	‘Mary, my dear, you will excuse us for a moment.
1993	Oh, dear McAllister, I have stopped making sense.
1993	How on earth was she to stop him — her dear Dr Neil who was so distracted by love that all his sense appeared to have left him?
1993	She crossed the room to him, put her hands on his lips, and said, ‘Hush, my dear Dr Neil, hush.
1993	‘And yes, of course I wish to marry you, and do you think, my dearest love, that, as Matey would say, we have both been struck by the asylum mop, we are carrying on so wildly, and shall I ever be sane again?
1993	No point in going to bed, dear, he trilled, I thought you'd like a cup of tea.
1993	And Mum Knows Best, so when the Pig went off with its Tart, she told Jan never mind, dear, there's always people making a mess somewhere, you can always clean it up.
1993	‘Oh hello, dear, were you busy?’
1993	‘Look dear, Joe's just been up with a tray of sumptuous goodies.
1993	I was just beginning to stop sweating when Jan leaned over  and whispered: ‘Why didn't you tell me he was a nancy boy, dear?
1993	Oh no dear, like I was saying to Basil, I don't mind what people get up to.
1993	‘That must have been awful,’ said Basil — Cherry again, now that he could talk about Men and the problems with them, dear!
1993	‘Your trouble, dear, is you're too hung-up.
1993	‘And if it's awful, dear,’ he said philosophically, ‘you can always escape to Raglan's.
1993	Dear God, let there be Guests, prayed Jessica, or let Daddy be away on business.
1993	Dear God, thought Jessica, seeing the words in her best handwriting, Dear God let it be all right when I get home and I'll never…
1993	Dear God, make everything all right and I'll always be nice to people, even May and Izzy.
1993	Oh dear.
1993	Take what you need, dear.
1993	His chin was a ragged hobo grey, eyes mad with lack of sleep and Vision, my dear Alex, –n!
1993	‘I had an aunt who said once, ‘Derek’,’ he quavered like Flora Robson, '’Derek, dear boy, I thrive on Things on Toast, d'you know, one can't get the help these days.’
1993	‘Champagne tastes, my dear.’
1993	If I tried — my dear, it  would be civil war.
1993	‘Oh dear, yes, I am very flattered.
1993	It's Raymond's annual regimental luncheon — so grand, my dear!
1993	‘I was so well-behaved, my dear,’ she told me over coffee, stretching like a mischievous cat.
1993	Well, it was so suitable, my dear, that the General's wife was wearing it too.
1993	‘My dear, what else could I do but join the Resistance?
1993	‘My dear,’ she said, ‘I will never be in a hospital or an old people's home.
1993	‘My dear, how the days go by!
1993	The potatoes could cast an eye over Jean-Paul Sartre and reshape their destiny: no more chips in her house, non, non, my dear, pommes frites.
1993	The wind had turned it into an octopus and the old lady muttered, ‘Oh dear, oh lord, oh good heavens, what a nuisance.’
1993	Orchids to You, Dear
1993	There was his dear head, bent close to a tousled blonde mop over a pile of papers.
1993	With satisfaction she noticed how her dear little hands were becoming calloused.
1993	Dear God, she was nothing but skin and bone, and she'd been a tiny slip of a thing to start with.
1993	Dearest wave bobber — you've shown me a living rainbow.’
1972	When he had them so placed, he spurred ahead and drew dear, and the archers cut them down like corn.
1972	‘Faith, and so do I, but we're like to pay dear for it.
1972	He neither gains an ally nor sweetens an enemy, and say she brings but a token household with her, yet it will cost him dear to keep them.
1972	She was small and fair like her name, shy like her mother, and his favourite child, dearer even than Thomas, for daughters are more fragile and vulnerable than sons, and she was his first daughter.
1972	And as for Mortimer, they shall pay dearer still for him.
1991	Make me some cheese on toast, there's a dear.
1991	‘Better to live in the present, dear,’ she said, ‘while you can.
1991	Dear Mrs Jones,
1991	‘Oh dear,’ said Ellen.
1993	Where's your auld dear?’
1993	Stevie and Patsy Mulligan are the sons of a dear friend who has recently passed away.
1993	And the auld dear's chattin' to Bernice just a' te corner there.
1993	After visiting me auld dear, we'll meet the others at Kimberly's house for a late supper.’
1993	Your dear brother left quite a few problems behind when he failed to take that corner.
1993	Hello, my dear, I'm so pleased you've called…’
1993	‘I already know about it, my dear, as does most of the world.
1993	‘I'm afraid we can, my dear.
1993	I'm now going to teach you a long-overdue lesson, my dear.
1993	Quite frankly, my dear, at the moment I don't give a damn what your feelings are.
1993	Dump your bags, dear, we'll take them up later.
1993	‘It's all right, my dear.
1993	Oh, dear!
1993	‘Go in and say we've found her, dear,’ orders Lil.
1993	‘No thanks, dear.
1993	I am — deliberately — ten minutes late, both for the sake of a dramatic entrance and to show them that frankly, my dears, I don't give a damn.
1993	Because frankly, my dear, they don't give a damn.’
1993	But only if you let me pay, dear.’
1993	‘You'll need to take the second right after those lights, dear.
1993	‘Find a dybbuk of your own, dear.’
1993	But that puts you in your place, dear.
1993	If Rainbow won't entertain these dear girls, then maybe I should.
1993	‘It's the most important part of the whole ensemble, dear.’
1993	Mere mortals, dear Rainbow, as you so rightly say, would present no threat.
1993	Oh dear, has she blown it?
1993	That house of hers is crammed to the rafters with mothers and sisters-in-law and groupies like your dear Aunt Goldie.’
1993	‘Oh, don't worry, dear, we have.
1973	He paused at one point on a low hill and cried aloud — perhaps not without a touch of relish for the dramatic, characteristic of his age —‘William, dearest little brother!
1973	Close by this spot wast thou murdered and thy dear innocence cast down!’
1973	‘William, my dear little angel!
1973	A man's voice replied, ‘Elizabeth, dearest Elizabeth, you must have thought of these things fully as much as I!
1973	You are his dearest friend, and must act accordingly.’
1973	Taking my arm as if in apology for a moment's neglect, Byron said, ‘My dear Bodenland, you must be acquainted with my fellow reprobate and exile.’
1973	‘You may give me a kiss, dear Mary, since it is soon to be your birthday.’
1973	‘Mary, dear, you upset my circulatory system when you parade these ideas you pinch from Percy,’ Byron said.
1973	‘Mary, dear, one night when I have made a better meal than I did tonight, I plan to go a little berserk, too, in order to have your solace.’
1973	And dear Shelley?
1973	Because our dear Claire is with child by Byron.
1973	The sun will never swing away from that casement window, for we have abolished time at a stroke, my dearest spirit!
1973	Ah, Mary, Mary Shelley, how dear you were and are, beyond all women — and yet what was possible then was only possible because we were mere phantoms in the world, or so we saw it, and scarcely less than phantoms to each other.
1973	Dearest Mary!’
1973	‘My dearest Joe!’
1973	‘You know I can't leave dear Shelley.
1973	‘Oh, dearest Mary…’
1973	My dear Mary Godwin,
1973	Between your age and mine, dear Mary, a re-education has taken place.
1973	And you, my dear Mary, respected though your name is — you are insufficiently regarded as the first of that invaluable breed,preceeding them by at least one whole generation!
1973	Then would be the time to go seeking dear Mary again.
1973	My dear Mary had had a truer idea when she called Victor ‘The Modern Prometheus’.
1973	A fleeting recollection, as the dying are supposed to relive past episodes: recollection of my old sane ordered life now lost by two centuries, of my dear wife, my valued friends, even some of my esteemed enemies, and of my little grandchildren.
1993	Robyn nodded and tried to decide who she'd throttle first — Luke or dear Melissa.
1993	‘I didn't ask to sit down to dinner with them, I didn't ask to be ridiculed and insulted by dear, delightful Melissa!’
1993	‘Dear Mummy and Daddy,’ he starts in English.
1993	It is John's dearest wish,’ Babur says.
1993	Mum said, ‘Dear, that's our flight.’
1993	‘The last time they called our flight she said, ‘That's the final call, dear.’
1993	Oh dear, Paul thinks.
1993	‘Oh, dear,’ Paul says.
1993	‘It's his dearest wish,’ Keith says, as if that explains everything.
1993	‘What's your dearest wish, my sweet man?’ he asks.
1993	‘Dear God in heaven!’ ejaculated Mr Beckenham on a tide of relief.
1993	Dear God, what the devil had his poor ghost done to excite her vicious enmity?
1993	Since I am certain that my dear cousin Araminta will neglect to inform you of it, allow me to introduce myself.
1993	My dear boy, what a lovely surprise!’
1993	‘And now, dear Aunt Lavvy, I have you all to myself!
1993	‘Dear God!
1993	‘Be sure I shall remember it, dearest Aunt.’
1993	‘Dear God in heaven, you are a witch!’
1993	‘Oh, my dear, I don't need help at all,’ she declared, ushering Theda inside a spacious saloon, its windows, open to the fresh air, letting in a good deal of light.
1993	‘Yes, my dear,’ smiled her hostess.
1993	‘Dear Lord!’ uttered Theda startled.
1993	‘Dear lord in heaven!
1993	‘With that pearly skin of yours, dear ghost, that flame was inevitable!’
1993	‘I have brought you here, Miss Kyte,’ resumed Miss Merchiston in what was for her a pleasant tone, ‘that you may tell Mr Quatt of what passed between yourself and my dear mother.’
1993	‘Of course nothing can be formally arranged just at this present,’ went on Miss Merchiston, and Theda almost laughed out to see the burgeoning hope in the poor man's face, ‘for with dear Mama in this sad condition, I could not reconcile it with my conscience to leave her in the care of other hands.
1993	Did you shrink from marriage with me, indeed, dear ghost?
1993	‘Dear ghost, I don't want you to float out of my life, to disappear without trace.
1993	‘Dear God !
1993	‘My dear Rose, pray sit down again,’ begged Theda, softening.
1993	‘Dear Theda, you must surely be able to see that for yourself.
1993	‘Oh, dear, how right you are!
1993	‘My dear Rose,’ Theda said with a smile, ‘you have so espoused Benedict's cause that you imagine it is enough to tell me all his unfortunate history to make me realise what I already know.
1993	‘Dear God !
1993	‘Oh, dear Lord!’ she exclaimed, dropping to her knees.
1993	Dear Lord, he did want her!
1993	Oh, dear Lord!
1993	‘My dear, Antoinette positively said ‘Kyte’, I am certain of it,’ one voice was saying.
1993	‘Quatt , my dear Mrs Tiverton,’ interpolated her companion, with a titter.
1993	‘Quite right, my dear,’ agreed the other.
1993	‘My dear Rose, we have been hearing of your protégé.
1993	‘Dear me!’ she gasped out.
1993	Dear lord, how was she to endure it?
1993	Dear lord,no .
1993	Dear God!
1993	Dear lord, what could she say?
1993	‘My dear Miss Kyte,’ said Lady Danby's voice, interrupting her reverie, ‘I am certainly going to take you to task for leaving my party so early.
1993	‘He has taken a marked fancy to you, my dear,’ pursued the other.
1993	‘My dear ma'am, I assure you I don't look for matrimony.
1993	Dear lord, one word from that dreadful old woman, and she was undone.
1993	‘Well, my dear, it is an old tale now.
1993	Like a drowning woman clinging to a frail piece of wreckage, she hung for dear life on to the bedpost while the images cluttered her mind: Benedict smiling; Caswell shocked; a loved face dying; the wasted face of Lady Lavinia dead, eyes open; Araminta's bitter, hating mouth; Rose's pleading smile for Benedict.
1993	Dear lord, when she had so longed for him!
1993	Dear ghost!
1993	‘Don't weep, dear ghost!
1993	Dear God, as if I needed this complication!
1993	But you —’ his fingers reached across to take her face between his hands, and there was deep compassion in his gaze ‘— you, dear ghost, don't understand.
1993	‘Dear lord, but we are poles apart!’
1993	‘Dear lord in heaven!’
1993	Oh, dear lord, Rose will tell him!
1993	You know nothing of women if that is what you believe, my dear.
1993	‘Dear God , of course!
1993	‘Oh, dear, Miss Theda, I wish you will think better of it!’
1993	‘Dear knows why he has not been back here these few days!’ muttered the housekeeper fretfully.
1993	Dear lord, she would have to go abroad!
1993	‘What is it, my dearest ghost?’
1993	‘Oh, dear lord!’
1993	Caswell was unworthy, just as you said, and untrue, as dear Mama would have it.
1993	‘You were only a child, my dear,’ sighed the Earl.
1993	‘Dearest ghost, did you imagine I would let it go to that hag of a cousin of mine?
1993	Dear heaven, he wasn't the local lunatic, was he?
1993	‘All right, dear?’
1993	‘No, but then how do you ever know that your dear little baby isn't going to grow up to be tall and elegant?’ she quipped with huge enjoyment.
1993	‘Hello, dear,’ she smiled.
1993	And I saw a dear little shed that someone had made into a craft shop, and the woman said no one had been in for ages, and wasn't she pleased to see me…’
1993	‘Aren't we all, dear?’
1993	‘Dear God,’ he interrupted, ‘no wonder you get away with murder, eyes so wide one would swear you were innocent.
1993	Dear me.’
1993	Oh dear, more unwitting genocide.
1993	Oh dear, out comes the erection, unsheathed like a family dog in the middle of the carpet, during supper.
1993	‘This dear child's loyalty is my greatest pleasure, and so useful.
1993	Dear lord, she had to speak, she told herself, staring down at her hands gripped tight in her lap.
1993	‘And I shall look forward to having you read to me, my dear, while you are with us.
1993	‘But I can see you are still troubled, my dear,’ observed the Queen kindly.
1993	And no need to fear that anyone outside this room will learn of it, my dear.
1993	‘Forget I asked, my dear.
1993	‘'TIS nought, my dear.
1993	Oh, dear God,he had !
1993	‘Dear God,’ whispered Joanna, glancing at the sky.
1993	‘Oh, dear God, why didn't I call the villagers into the castle?’
1993	‘A cup of wine, my dear Isabel?
1993	‘Dear me, I can see a lesson in manners will be called for.
1993	‘I've seen your husband before, my dear.
1993	You shall learn the delights of anticipation, my dear.’
1993	‘Dear God.
1993	‘She was a dream I held dear, but ‘tis the woman you are now that I love — sweet and true and courageous.’
1993	Let us then […]suppose a great increase in the general demand for fish, such for instance as might arise from a disease affecting farm stock, by which meat was made a dear and dangerous food for several years together.
0000	O is ‘Oh dear, can I have a second opinion?’
0000	Dear reader,
0000	‘Dear Mr Camdessus,
0000	I touched down on that planet during my homing, and all that remains of that great civilization, dear friends, are mountains of empty drink cans and a carpet of potato-chip packets.
0000	Dear reader,
1992	Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show, That she (dear she) might take some pleasure of my pain; Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know; Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain; I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe, Studying investions fine, her wits to entertain; Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburnt brain.
1993	‘My dear Roger, in London there are spies in the service of the Papacy, the Doge of Venice, the Emperor of the Romans, Ferdinand of Aragon…and the same is true of every capital in Europe.
1993	No one but dear Shallot himself so I pleaded not guilty and made my defence: I was Ralemberg's colleague, I had no grievance against him.
1993	‘Because, my dear nephew,’ Wolsey silkily intervened, ‘only I know what the seal actually looks like.
1993	And what did dear Uncle wish to impart?’
1993	‘My dear, dear Roger.
1993	Oh, dear, I thought, not much love lost here!
1993	‘I'll tell you in God's good time, as I will about the secret instructions dear Uncle gave me at Hampton Court.’
1993	‘In that case, my dear Roger, we learn French well and make friends with Monsieur Vauban because we can never return to England.’
1993	‘But you were Mr Russell's only child, my dear, and you must not doubt that he loved you, even if he didn't always make it perfectly apparent.’
1993	Then he said gently, ‘I don't think, my dear, that your father was always very wise.’
1993	‘Antoinette, my dear, you haven't met this young lady, who is paying a short visit from England.’
1993	What is your name, my dear?’
1993	Such a dear boy.
1993	‘How fierce you are, my dear Rohan,’ the Baronne intervened, openly amused.
1993	‘My favourites, you dear boy.’
1993	You are always so impatient, my dear boy.
1993	We had no children of our own,’ the Baronne almost choked on the words, ‘but there was always Antoinette, my beautiful, radiant Antoinette, dearer to me than any daughter could have been.
1993	‘Dear God, after that, it was like a siege.
1963	‘Now you mustn't talk like that, dear.
1963	‘Now dear,’ she said.
1963	‘I know, dear,’ Mrs Hellyer said respectfully.
1963	She said, ‘Emmie dear, do you have to scrub the floor on a hot afternoon like this?’
1963	She said, ‘You know, dear, we love to have you in and out of the house, but sometimes I think you hang around Nick too much.’
1963	Nick's publishing friend fitted his glasses more securely on the bridge of his nose and said, ‘My dear chap — I thought it was charming.
1963	My dear chap you couldn't put them in a work of fiction.
1963	‘Dear Sir, I am sending you my new book.
1963	‘Oh dear God,’ Emmie said, and went to the bathroom for rags.
1963	You poor, dear girl.’
1963	He was so quick, so  dear, so light.
1993	‘My good girl, you must be very naïve — as naïve, apparently, as my dear stepsister — if you think I'd contemplate even for one moment sharing these very cramped quarters with you.
1993	And to Robbie, ‘Are you a naturalist too, my dear?’
1993	‘Then you must certainly do so, my dear.
1993	‘Dear me, dear me!’
1993	‘My dear Robbie,’ he drawled, ‘you over-anticipate.
1993	‘My dear, your aunt Bertha means well —’
1993	‘My dear, you know I have Daddy to care for, as well as Gran.
1993	Bertha had looked at her in thoughtful silence for several long moments before she'd said, ‘Dear Lucy — I believe you could help me in this affair.’
1993	‘My dear Tom spoke of the place as an undeveloped shambles with Matt living there alone, although I've now heard that he and Silas accommodate a few guests.
1993	‘You can talk to him for me, my dear.
1993	Matt and I ran out of gas, for the simple reason that the dear old boy had forgotten to fill up while I was with the wholesaler.
1993	‘It began after my dear Tom had passed away and when Silas and this woman spoke of becoming engaged.
1993	‘My dear —she was referring to me as being bossy and domineering.
1993	‘My dear — don't allow his obsession for everything being first class at the Wilderness get under your skin.
1993	His tone had become thoroughly cynical; then he went on, ‘As it happens, I'm more than happy with dear old Matt near by.
1993	‘Thank you, my dear,’ Matt said, then he spoke seriously to Silas.
1993	Now that he's gone she refers to him as her dear Tom.
1993	It was only family loyalty that prevented Lucy from admitting that her aunt's references to her dear Tom had never sounded convincing, and, giving a small sigh, she said, ‘Perhaps I understand more than you realise.’
1993	There was a tense silence until she said, ‘Silas, dear — who is this — this person ?’
1993	‘Dear Silas,’ Doreen cooed.
1993	Silas, dear — I've come here to spend time with you.’
1993	Silas,dear …
1993	‘Be a dear girl and check that Ling has the hampers ready,’ he said.
1993	‘It's stupid to have three crammed into one seat while dear old Matt travels alone.’
1993	‘In any case, I've had about as much as I can take from your dear friend for today — thank you very much.’
1993	‘I'd like to see the old — er — the dear soul again.’
1993	‘Dear Bertha — I see you're still your same sweet and gracious self,’ he commented on a sardonic note.
1993	‘Dear boy — you're so like your father.
1993	He then unclipped his seatbelt and turned towards her, his arms enfolding her as he murmured, ‘You are a dear girl.
1993	Above her head Silas murmured, ‘I'll admit I've been slow — but we'll make up for it later, my dearest.’
1993	‘Then hear this, my dearest one — I love you.
1993	Dearest Silas — did I happen to tell you I love you?’ she queried shyly.
1993	‘Tomorrow, my dearest, we'll drive to Hastings to buy an engagement ring.
1992	I'd say that leaves the way dear for us to concentrate on the robberies.’
1990	Dear Sir,
1990	Dear Members,
1990	Dear Mr Young
1990	Dear Mr Young,
1990	Dear Member,
1992	Does my right hon. Friend realise that in dealing with things that we hold so dear we want to make sure that the European Community gives us a good bargain and that what we give to it will be given back to us?
1992	Oh dear, the hon. Gentleman is in a muddle.
1992	If she were interested in such a campaign, she could perhaps use as the model for it our own dear Speaker, whose radiant health and youthfulness make him the perfect epitome of a diet based on vegetarianism.
1992	Let me state a couple of fundamental principles that we hold dear.
1992	The House will recall my Adjournment debate of 22 January 1991 following the publication in December 1990 for the first time of the annual report by Her Majesty's inspector of constabulary, Mr. Geoffrey Dear.
1992	Mr. Dear painted a picture of a poorly funded, undermanned force under great pressure, and a chief constable with his hands tied behind his back by council rules and bureaucracy such that decisions on spending even minute amounts have to be referred to a committee, including items as minute as the installation of a telephone line.
1992	In all, Mr. Dear threatened to withhold the certificate of efficiency if matters did not improve.
1992	Mr. Dear has now returned to Derbyshire and has produced another interim report.
1992	Mr. Dear says that almost no action that could be registered and measured by Her Majesty's inspector has yet been taken by the police committee.
1992	The council's main reaction to Mr. Dear's complaints of undermanning has been to cut the force even further.
1992	I hope that in Committee he will listen to the pleas of Members representing Greater London and the south of England because they are dear to my heart and may to some extent be dear to his.
1992	In a’ Dear Colleague’letter circulated to all Members of Parliament, the Secretary of State for Education and Science warned us earlier in the year to beware of students who came to us during the recess pleading poverty.
1992	In his’ Dear Colleague’letter, the Secretary of State referred to the benefit that students could previously have claimed.
1992	In his’ Dear Colleague’letter the Secretary of State tells us that the uprating of student grants in 1990-91 was over and above the extra money made available through student loans.
1992	So dear Dr. Godman I feel I have been treated badly in this case and would be grateful if you would pursue this matter further.
1992	The matter is serious because if one inspects the photocopy of the letter one sees that he forged not only the heading but the’ Dear Dr.
1992	We must increase demand for British goods by adjusting the exchange rate so that demand is channelled to British goods through the price mechanism, making our goods and exports more attractive and cheaper and imports dearer.
1992	My dear friend — if I may so describe him — the previous Foreign Secretary, who resigned from the right hon. Lady's Government over Europe, was equally thrilled, although he did not express himself — he never does — in quite such colourful language.
0000	This study extends the work of a pilot study funded by ESRC (C/00/23/2220) which examined the interaction between dear parents and their infants in the first 12 months of life.
1993	Taking the wraps off dear Diana
1993	TO SOMEONE who has, in the past, had her intelligence insulted by experts, it presented no problem at all, last week, to respond to two programme makers with a sceptical, ‘Pull the other one, dear, it plays The Bells Of St Mary's.’
1993	‘Stuff is too dear now.
1993	I swear by all I hold dear the Koran, my wife, child and mother I had nothing to do with this.’
1993	No doubt the heads were dropping all round — dear oh dear, what's happening to us?

1985	Dear Helen,
0000	‘Hello dear,’ she wheezes, ‘And how are you today?’
0000	‘Ta-ta, dear,’ says Mrs Marsh.
0000	‘Oh dear, I'm bursting,’ she says, ‘I need the toilet.’
0000	Inevitably she says, ‘Oh dear, false alarm’ and we go back to her room.
0000	Dear me, she thought I was some old biddy needing bingo.’
0000	‘Oh dear, would you like to go home?
1989	But four bogies over the closing seven holes cost the Spaniard dear and let the Americans back into the match.
1984	Their shapes seemed as dear and familiar as friends' faces, she wanted to pat their cold metal bonnets.
1984	My dear Carolyn,
1984	‘I'm sorry we can't help you dear,’ she said.
1984	‘Haven't you noticed how often he takes his dear friend Councillor Waverly out to lunch?’
0000	Dear Mum,
0000	Dear Colleague, With the passage of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Bill in 1986, we may have thought that the animal rights movement would have become less militant and that scientific research would be subject to less disruption.

0000	Dear Mr Crowdy
1990	She urged Singh to resign the premiership "for the sake of the same morality we hold so dear" .
1991	The exiled Prime Minister and Crown Prince of Kuwait, Shaikh Saad al Abdullah as Salim as Sabah, in an address on Jan. 17 spoke of the "legitimate struggle to liberate our dear homeland from the evil Iraqi regime's occupation" .
1991	Saddam Hussein's unprovoked invasion, his ruthless systematic rape of a peaceful neighbour, violated everything the community of nations holds dear.
1991	Referring to the spate of recent pro-Iraqi demonstrations, Beg added that "the distrust of the USA among the people [of Pakistan]is because they fully know that Israel's security interests are dearer to it than anyone else" .
1991	There was considerable speculation (allegedly stemming from Chinese official sources) that Kim would use the occasion of his 78th birthday (on April 15) to complete the long-anticipated handover of power to his son, Kim Jong Il, the 48-year-old "Dear Leader" .
1993	Dear colleagues, it is my pleasure to send fraternal greetings to all delegates at the G M B Conference from the Executive Officers and Members of the T & G. In the twelve months since I last sent you our good wishes much activity has taken place within our movement.
1993	Dear friends, comradely greetings to your annual conference from the African National Congress.
1993	Dear oh dear!
1993	Oh dear, Dougie's getting a bit, I see Dougie's getting a bit er, yeah, erm
1993	Oh dear!
1993	Oh, sleet on Sunday, oh dear.
1993	Oh oh dear
1993	Ooh dear, I knew we shouldn't have done this.
1993	Oh dear.
1987	Oh dear.
1987	And then she'd dose you up with goose grease, oh dear that the thought of that now.
1987	And you always had one or two of them with you you know no matter where you went you oh dear.
1986	And all I got for that was a couple of tin medals, uh uh, aye dear  Aye.
1993	But oh dear what a gift.
1993	But for many people isn't it the case that the the church wedding is an an and the promises made the vows made before God and er before the the congregation, for many people they're just a sort of rather erm oh dear how can I put it rather a flimsy frippery erm that they just feel it's essential to have so that they can have the nice pictures and and look back on on a church wedding.
1993	They've already written to the Secretary of State and said dear Secretary of State we're going to send this to you because it is a departure but please Secretary of State do not call it in do not exercise your powers.
1991	‘Oh dear God, what shall I…what shall we do?’
1991	‘Yes, dear,’ said Eleanor.
1991	My dear girl, I'm a writer, not a private  investigator.
1991	‘I lost someone dear to me, very suddenly.’
1991	‘Oh, dear!’ whispered Sybil in some alarm.
1991	‘Oh dear!’
1991	‘You shall paint me like this if it would please you, Barney dear,’ she whispered aloud.
1991	‘Eleanor dear, what is it?’
1993	‘I can be of help to you, my dear,’ he assured her.
1993	‘Sauce, dear?’ said her companion.
1993	‘Dear Lord and Father of mankind, Forgive our foolish ways…
1993	Sir Ralph Grunte,(‘the ‘e’ is sounded, dear boy, as in Bronte’) stepped out of the next stall with pee on his brightly polished brown brogues.
1993	‘Well, my dear,’ he said, pressing his knees against Amaranth's, ‘so it's your intention to stand for Parliament?’
1993	There goes dear old Willie, thought Joshua, the non-playing captain of the Wets, who was finally persuaded to advise Margaret Thatcher that famous November that ‘the game was up’.
1993	She wondered whether ‘dear John’ would do the decent thing and send Ralph to the Lords.
1993	Although what use could dear Alfred have for any of them? she wondered.
1993	He had either supported Michael Heseltine in his leadership bid (‘disloyal to dear Mrs Thatcher’) or had failed to turn up to a multitude of constituency functions, wine and cheeses, bring and buys.
1993	Grunte, who affected never to have sought office —‘too many people dependent on me, dear boy, wheels of commerce and all that’— would have been only too delighted to accept the seals of any office.
1993	‘My dear Mrs Ormsby Gore
1993	Grunte's apologies, ‘my dear lady, I had no idea,’ caused much hilarity and more unrest.
1993	‘After five minutes, my dear, the amber; after six, the red.’
1993	‘Muesli, dear?
1993	The Mail had indeed captioned the picture ‘Take as long as you like, my dear, the floor is yours’.
1993	‘Is this man being a nuisance to you, my dear?
1993	‘Shall I accompany you, my dear?’ asked Mrs de Crespigny, and the two women left the hotel together.
1993	Amaranth sat in the back of the police car with Mrs de Crespigny (‘Nora, my dear’).
1993	One old dear was doing her knitting.
1982	Your dear, departed uncle
1982	Dear friends, I had hoped in due course
1992	or punting for dear life in the stream,
1992	nothing I do, dear reader,
1992	among the dear departed,
1991	on an edge, the dearer for its vanishing.
1978	‘Dear lady, you have carte blanche!
1978	‘Oh, yes, dear,’ Nora said.
1978	‘It is quite dear,’ he said, ‘that you are insane.’
1978	‘Aren't you pleased, Nora dear?’
1978	‘Oh, dear,’ John said.
1978	My dearest, I tell myself — what you will certainly say — that it is a landowner's inalienable right to do what he wishes with his own land I know all this — yet it does not stifle the cries of terrified children and the weeping of their parents.
1978	The girl shut her eyes and gripped back for dear life.
1978	Dear Rodie!’
1978	‘A very dear friend.
1991	They killed my dear husband
1991	‘I have received a letter from dear Mamma.

1992	Hail, O holy offspring of kings, Charles, dear to Christ!
1993	Innocent had misjudged the character of Otto, as he later admitted in a letter to Philip Augustus: "If only, dearest son, I had known the character of Otto who now calls himself Emperor, as well as you…
1985	Why not the dear old 23rd?— at least a decent bit of poetry.
1985	If our dear departed were not going to speak out against the Berlin talks as seemed altogether likely suppose — I must say suppose — that some deranged mind decided to eliminate him under the guise of a Muscovite attempt on the dear Praident?
1985	‘So like our dear friends from the secret services’ Sprague observed.
1985	‘Well if it comes to that I don't exactly trust the dear boy myself’ she had remarked to her mother who was winding up a short visit en route to stay with some Canadian cousins.
1985	‘Mother dear he is Army.
1985	‘All right, dear.
1985	‘Very well, dear.’
1985	‘So you met our dear D-G at the Steering Committee,’ she went on.
1985	Dear me,’ he smiled wanly; ‘I seem to be becoming quite conspiratorial.’
1985	Dear Mr Harbinger,
1966	‘He's a dear.
1966	‘Dear Heavenly father,’ Midwinter intoned.
1966	‘What are you doing in the dark, dearest?’ she said, swinging into the room and switching all the lights on.
1993	‘My dear Shah,’ said the headmaster, ‘this is stuff from the dawn of time.
1993	Absolutely, my dear boy!
1993	‘They do indeed wear ‘peculiar shoes’, my dear Wilson!
1993	‘My dear Wilson,’ he said, ‘all you need to know is that it is not yet come.
1993	‘My dear girl,’ Malik called to Maisie, ‘dance!’
1993	‘Please don't apologize, my dear Wilson.
1993	You flee it, my dear boy.’
1993	‘My dear Ali,’ he was saying, ‘our religion forbids us to eat pigs.
1993	‘Islam means surrender , my dear Wilson.
1993	What do you really hold dear, Robert?
1993	‘You want money, my dear Wilson?’
1993	‘Dear old Cuppers!’ he said.
1992	‘My dear…’ began Quigley.
1992	Whenever she said to him, ‘But, Norman — don't you want to sit in it, like other people?’ he would reply, rather grandly, ‘A garden, my dear, is a place for passing through as quickly as possible on the way to the pub.’
1992	The back wall of the First Church is littered with scrap pieces of paper on which are written things like PLEASE HELP AUNTIE JOAN THROUGH THIS PHASE OF THE TREATMENT or DEAR GOD, HELP ALL THE PEOPLE I SAW ON WATERLOO STATION THIS WEEKEND AND PRAY FOR ALL, ALIVE AND DECEASED, AT 110 HOLDEN ROAD, FINCHLEY.
1992	‘Oh dear Jesus Christ!’

1971	‘Dear mum, it's a bastard,’ he said.
1991	Dear Gould,
1991	‘My Dear Sir
1991	My Dear Sir
1991	My dear Mother,
1991	My dear little Louisa too is just at a critical age, teething in all probability.
1991	Bless their dear little faces.
1991	My Dear Eliza,
1991	God bless you my dear Eliza.
1991	Meantime it gives us great consolation to know that you and our dear children are well.
1991	And my dear little Eliza, is she as pretty as she was?
1991	And dear good-tempered little Charley…
1991	‘My dear Mother, Mrs Mitchell says, ‘Do let us know if you mean to bring home a little convict.’’
1991	My Dear Eliza,
1991	Must now conclude trusting my dear that every blessing will attend you and trusting I may find you well when I return — kiss dear Fritz [?]for me and believe me to remain Eliza
1991	My dear Eliza,
1991	I cannot tell you my Dear Eliza how great a shock I sustained.
1991	But at the end of all I sigh and think if I could but see old England again, and the dear, dear treasures it contains, I would contentedly sit down at my working table and stroke, stroke away to the end of the chapter, that is health permitting.’
1991	‘My dear Mrs Mitchell,
1991	I trust my dear Eliza you are still well and that you received my letter.
1991	‘How are the dear children?’ she asked Mrs Mitchell in a letter of 28 May, ‘Do they appear to retain any recollections of papa and Mamma?
1991	I often please myself with anticipations of our return, picture to myself the joy and greetings when we meet, and I try to fancy the appearance of the dear children — they will be grown out of all knowledge.’
1991	Dear Sir,
1991	Dear Sir William:
1982	Beyond the river, the plain married into wandering uplands where the low Lennox hills banded the horizon, a ridge thrusting eastwards above forest and hamlet to merge with the west Lothian hills and the Pentlands, and to end far to the left, where sea and sky met, with the crag, small and dear, of Dunedin.
1982	He consigned the thought, as a gift, to one of the two he held most dear.
1982	The pleasure he felt, and the calmness, and the determination burned as dear as the trees in the forest.
1982	But now, my dear Siward, I think the time has come to be provoked.’
1992	James Cossins recalled ‘the fun of the supper parties after filming all day in the  baking heat of the sand dunes around Almeria, and the joy that ensued when, after a suitable amount of alcohol, dear Roy Kinnear could be persuaded to do his celebrated impression of a one-armed golfer’.
1990	Dear Rab.
1990	My dear Ishbel is splendid.
1990	Today 23 years ago dear Grandmama died.
1978	the dear old thing afraid of a khaki envelope?
1990	An example of the application of Foucault to the ‘urban’ sphere is Dear and Wolch's research on what Giddens would no doubt call the ‘sequestrated region’of North American inner cities.
1990	But Dear and Wolch's main point is that the daily lives of those dependent on welfare are suffused in largely intangible and invisible ways by the institutions on which they are dependent.
1992	And then, when I was taking the exhibition down, a couple of women helped me and they said, ‘Why are you so angry, dear?’
1992	What I had heard was ‘I'm sure it will be alright, dear!’ from almost all the mothers I met.
1992	Dear Alison

1985	‘They're coming, dear.
1985	To her astonishment Mrs Rae patted Mr Patel and said,’ So will I. Off you go, dear.
1985	‘Dear ladies, how can I thank you?’
1985	‘It was nothing at all, dear,’ Mrs Rae assured him.
1985	‘Dear Madge,
1985	Dear Robert,
1985	‘Can I help you, dear?’ a kindly voice offered.
1989	Back in I 986, for example, the Nuclear Energy Agency estimated that the Sizewell ‘s' nuclear-power station now being built in Suffolk would be one-third cheaper than an equivalent coal-fired station at a 5% rate of return; at 10% the agency thought it would be dearer.
1989	Jewels worn in remembrance of dear ones lost, or exchanged between lovers as tokens, were extremely popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, although the ubiquitous lockets containing tresses of hair were perhaps the least subtle of these keepsakes. fit a time when the language of such things was far better understood than it is today, hearts and flowers, birds and beasts and a multitude of other symbols were incorporated into jewellery design to signify romantic love, to represent those sentiments and virtues which were the major preoccupation of the day.
1989	If you would like to help, please write a letter stating the following:’ Dear Mayor Gordon, I have heard about the work of the Buklod Centre and the programmes it runs for the hospitality women, including health education, English lessons, income-generating projects and night care for children.
0000	The list included two acquaintances and one very dear friend of mine.
1993	But the embalmer's world is not a cloistered one: Winter ‘92 included a review of the Art of Death exhibition at the V & a , whose message of demystification is one embalmers throughout the world hold dear.’

1993	‘Pay attention, dear boy.
1993	‘Be guided by me, my dear girl.
1993	‘I'm afraid Colonel Fagg has taken an objection to you, dear boy,’ said Gooseneck to Amiss that lunch-time.
1993	‘Oh dear, oh dear, let me put that away, Cully.
1993	‘Now, my dear friend, what would you like?’
1993	Robert, yes, Robert, isn't it, dear boy.’
1993	Oh, dear.
1993	With the exception of Glastonbury, who produced the occasional ‘Oh dear, I don't know’ sound, those present were also united on the general untrustworthiness of the late Trueman.
1993	‘Oh dear!
1993	‘My dear boy,’ said Gooseneck.
1993	‘My dear, dear boy.’
1993	The dear Commander.
1993	Not really the sort of thing that dear old Boy Glastonbury, who was then chairman, could have been expected to deal with.
1993	‘My dear boy,’ he said, ‘the choice is between feeding your mind or their bodies: I give priority to the former.’
1993	‘Well, of course, dear old Fagg is a great man for believing whatever suits him and obviously the notion that this was an inside job is unlikely to appeal.
1993	‘No, no, my dear fellow.
1993	‘Oh, I'm so sorry, my dear boy.
1993	Will you forgive me, my dear Cully.
1993	‘No, no, my dear young man.

1993	And thank you, dear boy,’ he said to Pooley.
1993	‘My dear Ellis, continue like this and I'll put a word in for you and get you job.’
1993	Oh dear, Cully, I've heard this substance is very, very dangerous.

1993	‘Your kind instincts do you credit, my dear Robert, but have no fear, I have no desire to torture our Islamic friends.’
1993	‘You appear surprised, my dear boy.
1993	‘Perfectly, my dear man.’
1993	I must have unnerved you, dear boy.
1990	‘Oh, dear,’ said a lady nome, faintly.
1990	‘Well, it's better than sitting around wringing our hands and saying, ‘Oh dear, oh dear, the humans are coming and we shall all be squashed.’’
1990	‘Oh dear,’ he said.
1990	‘You must not think of it like that, dear,’ Stevie told her gently.
1990	‘We can control them on the course reasonably well, but when they get into their cars, oh dear!’
1991	Oh dear.
1991	I sneaked a glance to my left but all I could see was a rather attractive young nurse wheeling a chair-ridden white-haired old dear down the corridor towards us.
1991	‘I really don't see how we can accommodate your dear grandmother at such short notice…
1991	As she went by, the old dear cackled loudly and yelled: ‘Did you see the arse on that, young Sally?
1991	Miranda appeared in the doorway of No. 9 and said, ‘Are you coming in now, darling?’ like other wives would say, ‘Had a nice day at the office, dear?’

1990	Only Morthen knew where…dear Morthen…’
1987	A job your dear mother would be proud to see you in.
1987	Dear brother, let me out of this awful place and the blessed Virgin will reward you.
1988	‘Oh, dear,’ said Loretta, trying to sound contrite in spite of her secret relief.
1988	Oh, dear,’ she added, a new thought striking her, ‘it doesn't give one great confidence in the police, does it?’
1988	‘Dear Loretta,’ she read, ‘I've just come back from an official trip to Italy, and I squeezed in a visit to a peace camp while I was there.
1988	Oh dear, I think you'd be more at home in Dr Sykes's little classes.

1993	‘Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.’
1993	‘Oh dear, oh dear,’ groaned Rex.
1993	‘Oh dear.
1993	Placed there —’ a plaintive tone entered the voice of the other Rex ‘— for the murder of our dear white-haired old mother, whom he killed and ate.’
1993	‘Oh shame, shame,’ went the large men, who all had dear white-haired old mothers of their own.
1993	Dear white-haired old mother and everything.
1993	Jonathan tapped once more at his dear little nose.

1992	So  if you think about it a therapeutic group could certainly use suggestive therapy like hypnosis and my guess is that most successful groups like Alcoholics Anonymous or groups of people who wanna stop smoking or do slimming and things like that succeed for that reason, cos every member of the group reinforces every other member with a kind of group super ego and says look, you mustn't smoke, you mustn't drink, you mustn't put on weight and it, it reinforces every individual's erm  super ego by means of identification with the shared value of the group and  similarly reduces feelings of shame and guilt if the individual fails the group, cos next week when they come back they say oh dear, I've put on five pounds, erm that they're gonna feel bad about it because it offends against the ideal of the of the group if it's Weight Watchers or something.
1991	Erm  I'll, oh dear  copies either .

1993	And don't forget Charlie, dear Charlie, the great musician.
1993	But when there was no retort from her granddaughter, she turned her head and looked at the young woman lying with her back against the head of the couch, her eyes closed, the muscles of her jaws showing white through the skin, and, her tone changing, she enquired, ‘What is it, dear?
1993	‘And you never seem to have any fun, do you, dear?’
1993	‘Look, my dear, I'm not in my dotage yet, and I know I'm a grumbler and a complainer.
1993	Oh yes, I do, dear.
1993	And you  know, dear, I've been a mother.
1993	Oh dear me.’
1993	‘Funny that, dear, I couldn't talk to Lizzie, not to my own daughter.

1993	‘It happened a long time ago, my dear, when we were quite small, romping in the wood.
1993	Oh yes, my dear.’
1993	And her grandmother called from the scullery, ‘Is that you, dear?’

1993	Yes, dear.
1993	No, dear; no, I haven't got a headache.’
1993	Yes, you are, dear.’

1993	Peggy leaned over and drew her daughter into her arms, saying, ‘Oh my dear, no, no.
1993	‘Dear God!’
1993	Dear God in heaven!’
1993	‘Oh, my dear, he'll tell you all about it later.
1993	‘Sit down, dear.’
1993	He laughed now, saying, ‘My dear, dear, Peggy, you'll always be the same to me.
1993	Dear God, didn't she?
1993	‘Well, my dear, just think back; you weren't many months older.’

1994	It was only when I rang her up to chase up what had happened to the  she says, oh dear I've sent it to the wrong one.
1994	Oh dear, sorry, made a mistake, yes?
1994	And he will have told  that that erm The  prices are four per cent below yours dear boy .
1991	‘How very flattering, my dear Shiona, that you should keep such a careful check on my movements.’
1991	How she hated the way he called her ‘my dear Shiona’.
1991	‘But then, I, my dear Shiona, saw through you from the start.’
1991	‘The house, my dear Shiona.
1991	‘I already have several houses, my dear Shiona.
1991	‘You, my dear Shiona, are the one who has plans to play around with her future.
1991	‘Come, come, my dear Shiona.
1991	‘Believe me, my dear Shiona, if I could, I'd much prefer to say something pleasant.’
1991	‘Oh, no, my dear Shiona, it's based on much more than that.’
1991	‘What I'm saying, my dear Shiona, is really very simple…’
1991	‘You see, my very dear Shiona, I'm planning to get married in a couple of weeks’ time.’
1991	And I know how much the latter means to you, my dear.’
1991	‘Oh, yes, my dear Shiona, I'm absolutely sure.
1991	‘There's no secrecy, dear Shiona.
1991	‘It has long been my opinion that you, my dear Shiona, are the most contemptible individual that I have ever encountered.’
1991	‘I think, my dear Shiona, you've rather got that the wrong way round.
1991	The only one I'm worried about doing things behind my back, my dear Shiona, is your sweet self.’
1991	‘In spite of your intuition, my dear Shiona, Janice is a much nicer person than you, and far more suited to be Kirsty's mother.’
1991	‘So put me right, my dear, since you keep insisting I'm mistaken.
1991	‘Why, my dear Shiona?
1991	‘This is my own room, my dear Shiona.’
1991	‘Don't worry, dear Shiona.
1991	‘I mean, my dear Shiona, that I must have your absolute assurance that you don't intend trying to spirit her away again.’
1991	‘Oh, no, my dear Shiona, I fear I have never been wrong about you.
1991	‘My poor, dear Shiona.’
1991	‘My dear Shiona, you were his saviour.’
1991	‘It was my intention, my dear Shiona, to tear you apart.’
1991	‘My dear Shiona…
1991	‘Besides which, my dear Shiona, I've waited long enough for you, and I've just come all the way from Loch Lomond to propose to you.
1991	‘I believe in fairy-stories too, my dear.’
1991	‘I've never pursued any man in my life!’ she flared, stung by his disparaging ‘dear’as much as by what he seemed to believe.
1991	You insult my intelligence, my dear.’
1991	Sarella wished he would stop calling her his dear.
1991	‘Well, you might not have, my dear,’ he added unfuriatingly, and apparently impervious to the effect he was having, ‘though I by no means concede that point.
1991	‘Even you can't go against the wishes of a dead autocrat like Uncle,’ replied Peter, ‘though it's probably your dearest ambition!
1991	‘Your disappearance, my dear,’ he said with a slight bow, ‘would speak louder than words.’
1991	He's the dearest, sweetest boy who —’
1991	‘So you see, my dear, you really are wasting your time.
1991	‘Because, my dear,’ Marc gave a perceptible sigh, ‘as I've already suggested, if you're not going to play it my way you can best show your regard for him by taking up my alternative offer of an airline ticket before he returns.
1991	Only one thing was clear: she mustn't hurt dear Peter.
1991	‘Pigeons always come home to roost, my dear.’
1991	‘The fact is, my dear boy, you've entered into a liaison with a woman who is totally unsuitable on every count.’
1991	You, my dear, thought you were being particularly clever.
1991	‘Forgive me, my dear,’ he ground out, ignoring the scarlet imprint on the side of his face, ‘it seems I misread you at every turn — how extraordinary!
1992	‘Is this man pestering you, dear?’
1992	‘Well, that soon sorted him out, didn't it, dear?
1992	Oh dear, if only you'd explained it all to me last night!’ she said accusingly to Fran.
1992	Oh, dear, oh, dear, this is all turning into a rather nasty mess, isn't it?
1992	Nothing nasty, you'll be relieved to know — this isn't the sack, Miss Williams, dear me, no!’
1993	I don't envy you having to tell the dear lady that she'll have to spend the rest of her holiday with her wrist in plaster!’
1993	On the other hand, Lindsey found herself thinking, if Niall smiled at her the way he had smiled a few minutes ago, the dear lady probably wouldn't even need an anaesthetic!
1993	‘Oh dear!’
1993	‘We certainly have, my dear.’
1992	‘Oh, dear — you poor old hag!’ her friend murmured sardonically, grinning as she deftly caught hold of the cushion Laura had sent flying across the room towards her.
1992	‘My dear Laura,’ he drawled smoothly, looking down at her flushed cheeks, the blue eyes glinting with indignation, and her full lips trembling with rage and fury.
1992	‘I can assure you, my dear Laura, that I have neither the inclination nor the energy to lay my hands on your fair body,’ he drawled sardonically.
1992	‘But, my dear Laura, that's exactly what you were doing — only five minutes ago!’
1992	‘I mean, my dear Laura, that, since you are married to me — and I do not intend to give you a divorce — any question of your remarriage to anyone else simply doesn't arise!’
1992	‘Let us not forget dear Marissa…!’
1992	It just breaks my heart, honey, to think of your poor, dear cousin in such pain,’ the other woman murmured sympathetically, her eyes glistening with tears as she begged Laura to sit down and make herself comfortable.
1992	‘Oh, dear, I hope I haven't said the wrong thing?
1992	‘You won't believe it, but my dear mother-in-law has shoved me permanently up in the attic with the children,and we're expected to stay up there all the time.
1992	‘Oh, dear!
1992	In the end, our dear mother-in-law was yelling louder than the children!’
1992	‘My dearest Laura!
1992	However, this was clearly not the moment in which to tell his dearest Laura that she looked magnificent when she was angry, and he hastened to set the record straight.
1990	‘Oh, dear!
1990	‘I know you did, dear, and I appreciate it, I really do, and so will your father when he's had time to think about it; but you must admit, he does have a point — about David Markham, I mean.
1993	Oh, dear, she hadn't made a very good impression on the fabulous Dr Kent.
1993	‘Goodnight, dear.’
1993	‘It was quite understandable, dear.
1993	‘Oh, dear, no time for that, I'm afraid,’ said Nigel, getting up.
1993	‘Oh, dear — what happened?’
1993	Oh, no, dear, she doesn't live here any more.’
1993	‘My dear girl, you've hardly started!
1993	‘My dear Juliet, how many more times do I have to tell you I'm doing this because it interests me?
1993	‘My dear, your real mother has been looking after you for the past twenty years,’ said Miss Rose sharply.
1993	I'm sorry, dear, I don't know that name at all.
1993	‘Oh, you're back early, dear.
1993	‘All right, dear?’ asked her mother, keeping her gaze on the television screen.
1993	‘Is that likely, dear?’ said Irene.
1993	‘I did warn you, dear,’ said Irene.
1993	Oh, dear, what an embarrassing state of affairs, thought Juliet, as she filed them away.
1993	Oh, dear, thought Juliet, as she crossed the grass towards the river.
1993	‘Only by letter, dear.
1991	‘Well, there's more than one flat for rent in London, isn't there?’ their father chipped in to declare, and then, with a fond look at his wife, ‘And if there isn't, my dear — well, I'm sure, for such a good cause, we could consider letting Leith and Sebastian have the inheritance from their grandfather before they're twenty-five.’
1991	The root cause for her worry, for her looking back instead of forward, was her dear brother Sebastian and how, a week ago, as casual as could be, considering his name was on the mortgage agreement the same as hers, she had received a postcard from him.
1991	‘Naturally, he's seen to it that his commitments are met, hasn't he, dear?’
1991	Dear heaven, what a man!
1991	‘Oh, I expect so, dear,’ her mother replied, quite obviously thrilled at the lovely long letter she had received from her adored son.
1991	Oh, the dear love, thought Leith, having just realised that, heartsick for a sight of Rosemary, he must have been hoping that Rosemary was back and that she might, if asked, come over for a cup of coffee.
1991	‘I do hope that's not my lasagne I can smell burning, my dear,’ and while she moved swiftly to check the oven and to find that not a thing was burning, Naylor was saying, ‘We'll see you at the weekend, Travis.’
1991	Oh, dear, Leith thought, he's panicking.
1991	Oh, dear, she thought, half an hour late, and I get a persecution complex — of course people weren't staring at her.
1991	Oh, dear heavens, had Naylor, by seeing she was hurt, seen too that she cared deeply for him?
1992	She was an only child, and well aware that her father's dearest wish was to have grandsons.
1992	Oh, dear God, how am I going to live without him…?
1991	But it seems I've been a bit blasé about pregnancy's being ‘a perfectly natural physical state’— dear Dr Newne hit his surgery roof when I casually mentioned flying to St Lucia!
1991	‘Oh, dear.
1991	But I'm very proud of you, and your mother would have been, too…you worked harder than most to get that degree, my dear, even putting your health at risk…’
1991	‘Oh, dear, I hardly know what to say!’
1991	‘I'm well aware of that, my dear.’
1993	Dear God, was she out of her mind?
1993	‘Because Ruth, dear one, there was nothing to hold on to.
1993	‘Dear God, Steve, after tonight you're going to have to take the pledge…join a monastery —’
1993	‘Dear God, did it mean so very little to you that you can't remember every last detail of it?’ he questioned derisively.
1993	Oh, dear God, she was holding Maria Luisa's child in her arms.
1993	Oh, dear God, they had a baby, together they had a baby!
1993	Dear God, all this was none of her business anyway.
1993	Dear God, but I gave you my heart and my very soul —’
1993	You, dear Ruth, with your successful company, your beauty, your intelligence, how could you let your sensibility come up with the very idea that Maria Luisa's baby is mine?’
1993	‘It isn't mine, dear Ruth.
1992	‘Dear God, Rory,’ he murmured, ‘you're driving me out of my mind!’
1992	Dear heaven, what now?
1993	‘She tends to get a bit befuddled, poor old dear.’
1993	‘Have you seen them, Mandy, dear?’
1993	Have you seen my glasses, dear?’
1993	‘Then I guess you and I are toast, my dear.
1993	‘And with what shall we light it, dear Liza?’
1993	‘Oh, dear,’ Charity said with soft sympathy.
1993	Nelson, having appointed her Anpetuwi's own version of ‘Dear Abby’, took the trouble to seek her out to consult her about a problem he was having with the chambermaid, Billie.
1993	Her ‘Dear Abby’ voice, Nelson would call it.
1993	Charity, dear, we need a doctor,’ she whispered.
1993	Caroline, dear —’
1993	‘His Excellency is waiting for you, my dear.’
1993	‘Pay no attention to my grandson, my dear,’ she said.
1993	‘My dear,’ he said.
1993	‘I never remember which it is you American girls prefer, my dear, coffee or tea — or is it chocolate?
1993	‘It would give me great pleasure, my dear child.’
1993	‘Sit down, dear, and visit.’
1993	‘Oh, my dear!
1993	I am not your — your dear, or whatever that silly word means.’
1993	She was holding on for dear life, leaning into him, lifting on tiptoe so that he could gather her close, hold her tightly in his arms, while his tongue slipped into her mouth, while his hand swept up her ribs and lightly cupped her breast…
1993	‘How does that sound, dear?
1993	Do you, dear?’
1993	‘Did you enjoy yourself yesterday, my dear?’ she asked.
1993	‘Yes, dear?
1993	Someone from your very own country, my dear.
1993	‘Oh, please, my dear, don't disappoint me!
1993	‘There you are, dear,’ Anna said as Caroline stepped into the room.
1993	I am not your ‘dear’, and I resent —’
1993	Everything about him was so dear to her now; his smile, his face, the soft huskiness in his voice that told her he wanted her.
1993	Would it say, ‘Dear Miss Bishop, Thank you for your recent enquiry, but…’ which was what the letters from Parsons and FIT had said.
1993	‘Dear Miss Bishop,’ she read aloud.
1993	But he ignored her, his mouth moving slowly over hers, not with anger, not even with desire, but with something so sweet, so dear, that Caroline began to tremble.
1992	When you run out of money you'll have to use the only asset you have left, and then, my dear Paige, I'll have you!’
1992	Dear lord, he was insufferable!
1992	‘I shouldn't be touching you either, but, dear God, I think I must.’
1992	‘Just this, dear coz.
1992	‘Oh, dear, have I upset you, Paige?
1992	Dear lord, but it hurt.
1992	‘Paige, my dear child, come in, come in,’ he invited warmly, sounding almost as if he was expecting her.
1992	Come in, my dear, and tell me all about it,’ he urged, and for the second time in just over twenty-four hours Paige burst into tears.
1992	‘My dear Paige, at my age, nothing seems as hopeless as it does to you.
1992	‘Ah, Paige, my dear, you're just the person I need.
1992	‘Well, my dear, Travis is pretty much a law unto himself,’ Jonas pacified, watching his grandson make himself comfortable on the top step.
1992	‘My dear, that was very graciously said.
1992	Don't be too long joining the party — after all, my dears, it is for you.’
1993	‘I must go, my dear.
1993	That is, if my dear boss doesn't find me something to do on Saturday.
1993	‘It's all an act, my dear.
1993	‘Thank you, my — dear.’
1993	But I will keep my word, my dear — I can see just how much it means to you.’
1993	‘Oh, dear, then you are still too uptight.’
1993	‘There's no danger of that, I assure you, Rosie, dear.’
1993	‘You put it very well, my dear.
1993	Mrs Richards confided in Shelley, ‘Because you have such a sweet and caring face, my dear.’
1993	In spite of your tan, you're looking a bit peaky, my dear.’
1993	Now close your eyes, my dear, and sleep a little.’
1993	‘Pain, Shelley dear, pain, pain, pain.
1993	‘I'm sorry, but I cannot be at your beck and call all the time, my dear.
1993	‘Rosie, dear, last night was an experience.
1993	Shelley, dear, stay, please!
1993	Look after yourself, my dear, and sleep well.’
1993	Let dear old Miguelito charm a new generation of English roses — Shelley had outgrown him, although she would always keep a special place in her inner being for that lovely evening when she and only she had had his sweet and undivided attention…
1993	‘That might be true of you, Shelley, dear, but remember, I run a successful business as well as a medical practice, so having a wife as well shouldn't make much difference.’
1993	‘I know, my dear.
1993	Never ever say that hope is gone, my dear.
1993	‘That dear sweet boy Miguel is giving him a lift.’
1993	‘Dear sweet boy?’
1993	‘What did you say, dear?’
1993	But not if that dear sweet boy is anywhere around…
1993	Ever since we met, my dear, so gently and subtly you've been teaching me, you and Miguelito, and instead of thanking you I had this attack of childish pique and blamed you for hurting my feelings!
1993	She paused and looked at his dear face again.
1993	Her voice low and full of emotion, she went on, ‘Take no notice of me rambling away like this, dear, dear Miguelito.
1993	‘Not angry, dear, no.
1993	‘Well, well, well — I do believe our dear Sister Hennessy is speechless!’
1993	‘My dear girl, nothing I could do could possibly undermine your authority,’ he drawled lazily.
1993	Dear God, she was lovely.
1993	Dear God, what had he done to her?
1993	‘Dear God, how could anyone do that?’
1993	‘My dear girl, you were sitting on my lap!’
1993	Oh, dear, poor little tyke.
1991	‘My dear child, is it possible you're embarrassed?
1991	‘My dear little castaway,’ he drawled, ‘surely you didn't imagine I was offering myself as companion for the night?
1991	‘My dear girl, it was no hardship to hold you in my arms for a while, I assure you!’
1991	‘My dear young woman,’ he drawled, ‘must you shy away like a startled horse every time I get within yards of you?
1991	‘My dear child,’ said Mrs Vaughan, a look on her face Leonora could have sworn was relief.
1991	‘Penry was rather mysterious about you, my dear,’ said the latter, and patted one of the dining chairs ranged along the wall.
1991	Dear heaven, child, you were so lucky to survive!’
1991	Or perhaps you don't know about that — goodness, dear, you've gone a very funny colour!’
1993	‘Dearest Katya,’ said Lydia with a frozen smile, ‘is planning on wearing a scarlet dress to the wedding.’
1993	‘Oh, dear!’
1993	Sophie, my dear, it's a veterinary practice.
1993	‘Oh, dear.’
1993	They don't think it's what they call ‘right’ for women to do jobs like castrations, and it seems to embarrass the poor dears to talk of putting heifers to the bull and dealing with calving cases, or to discuss the sexual behaviour of their animals.’
1993	Oh, dear, I hope I am.’
1993	‘You're not to think of it, my dear.’
1993	‘Oh, dear,’ Sophie laughed, ‘that's a bit dictatorial.
1993	Then it was Edward's turn, and after that he said, ‘I'm glad you approve, my dear.
1993	‘Oh, dear,’ Sophie said inadequately, then sat silently for a long minute.
1993	‘My dear!
1993	‘My dear, don't look so amazed.
1993	The smile on her sweet mouth quickly faded though the moment the door was opened and she at once took in the unusual pallor of Cara's skin and the fact that, if she wasn't mistaken, her dear sister had recently been crying.
1993	Thoughts of her dear sister and all that she must be going through started to get to her, and, as love and conscience did a double act, she couldn't help thinking that surely she could do more.
1993	‘Oh, dear,’ Fabia muttered, trying to look intelligent but an alternator meaning nothing to her.
1993	‘Yes, dear?’ her mother prompted.
1993	‘And although he's much better, the dear love isn't out of the woods yet.
1993	There was a hint of a smile on his face anyhow when, ‘I think, then, my dear, that as far as possible you'd better keep your distance from me,’ he stated.
1993	But, ‘Oh, my dear,’ he followed on, and tenderly, with one finger, he traced the outline of her left breast.
1993	I confess I meant to hurt your pride — but, oh, dear Fabia,’ he said softly, and, his aggression all at once split asunder, he reached for her, took her in his arms, and gently cradled her to him.
1993	‘I'm not Superman, my dear,’ he made her bruised chin immediately better with that warm-sounding ‘my dear,’‘so what else could I do — and I own that I wasn't thinking at all too clearly — but appeal to the pride I'd seen in you?’
1993	Fabia was staring at him, struck dumb, when suddenly he let go one of her arms, placed an arm about her shoulders and, looking deeply into her eyes, said throatily ‘My dear, dear, Fabia, cannot you see how it is for me?’
1993	‘My dear,’ he translated for her.
1993	‘Oh, dear — jealousy?’ she queried softly.
1993	‘Oh, my dear heart,’ Ven breathed, and held her close up against him for long, long happy minutes.
1993	‘Oh, little love,’ he breathed, and while from his adoring tone she knew herself forgiven, ‘I — don't know quite how to tell you this —’He paused, but, clearly deciding that there was only one way, he proceeded to completely stagger her when, ‘It is a fact, my dear, that I did not, and never have, promised an interview to your sister, or to anyone else representing Verity magazine.’
1993	‘Oh, dear.
1993	Thank you, dear love!’ he declared fervently, and, as his head came down and he tenderly touched her mouth with his, ‘We'll get married soon,miláčku ,’he decreed.
1994	What er do you ever have people you know perhaps people who are close erm dear to you who use certain language that you find erm er either  or do you use methods which say getting your point across to people that .

1994	oh, oh dear, oh no
1994	Oh dear.
1994	Oh dear.
1989	yeah, well let me just read you two or three verses from Exodus, chapter forty, this is what it says  then the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle and Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle and throughout all their journeys whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle the sons of Israel would set out, but if the cloud was not taken up then they did not set out until the day that it was taken up, for throughout all their journeys the cloud of the Lord was on the tabernacle by day and there was fire in it by night, in the sight of all the house in Israel  and if you were to turn over to kings you've got a, you've got a similar thing there with the dedication of the temple and as Be Ben was saying the power really it's the it's the presence of God, the shine, the glory, that cloud of, and so what, what, what catches the Lord Jesus up is really the glory of God here he is, the, the riseness, the glorified Christ being called up into heaven in the, in the glory, what he's been glorified, so he withdraws his physical, physical presence from one place here on earth to present there on the throne and yet by the holy spirit to be every where  now Jesus then, he didn't cease to be truly man at either his resurrection or at his ascension, he stays man, God, the God man all the way through  and it's still true today he is the God man today and that's important for you and me, think of the very worse experience that you have ever had in your life, think of the very worse experience that could happen to you, with the exception of you know that of, of say total failure of some awful sin, the worse thing, maybe a loss of someone dear to you, someone very close to you, er, er, a bereavement, the most awful experience you have had  well  he has gone through, he has known that experience, he has, has tempted in all points like as we are  he knows our frame, he remembers were dust and he has been there and it is a man who has experienced those same experiences that you and I experience day by day, year after year, it is a man who has gone that, who has walked that path, who is in heaven interceding and praying for us, we'll stop there cos time has gone  erm we'll stop there, we won't go on otherwise I'll get into trouble   During this past month some of the questions in the New Testament, the first one we looked at you remember was that question that Jesus asked of his disciples, do you believe that I am able to do this, then we looked at a question which the disciples asked of Jesus, why could we not cast it out  last week we looked at another question, are only a few people going to be saved  and this morning I'd like us it's the final one of these questions not that there aren't other questions in the New Testament and scores, scores of others but were just looking at four er throughout this month, I'd like us to look this morning for one at, for a few minutes, at one that Jesus asked of a man who confronted him, I'd like to read a few verses from Luke chapter eighteen, Luke chapter eighteen  I'm gonna read from verse thirty five, it's the well known account of blind Bartimaeus, Luke chapter eighteen and verse thirty five  and he came about that as Jesus was approaching Jericho a certain blind man was sitting by the road begging, now hearing a multitude going by he began to inquire
1989	Dear Lord we, we want to be of use to you, we want to be of service to you, we want to be salt and light in our communities, we want to be your labourers, working together with you.
1989	He wrote what must have been the one of the shortest letters of all time, and he wrote back to the editor of The Times and he said, dear sir, in answer to your question what is wrong with the world
1989	And the, whilst the one side was good there was the other side, and when he heard that the inheritance required that he marry Ruth, oh dear!
1993	Oh dear.
0000	Oh dear me!
1992	And some old dear old lady fell out, off the edge of the kerb
0000	Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday dear Antony, Happy Birthday to you
0000	You go on through and si sorry seven is a pointer, eight is a Jack Russell which apparently is rather snappy and used for rabbiting, so I'm told, nine is Dalmatian , number ten's a labrador, golden coloured, guide dog main use and so on and then oh dear, it's finished, the programme's stopped.
1992	He stood there, no I don't mean that, I mean me rubbish, oh dear, and he said erm  er, sorry, he started sipping his coffee, he never said anything and then he says I've got some bad news for you and I said oh my God no, car accident, I just heard it on the radio  he said no, then he told me, oh God I nearly

0000	Whether she is consciously twisting logic, or just, poor girl, confused, I'm not sure, but at the end it's quite clear ‘So dear I love them that with him all deaths I could endure, without him live no life’, that she's got into a world of fantasy because the one thing that is of course not in question is that Adam should die and that she should live on, which appears to be what she's referring to here.
0000	Oh dear, what?
0000	I mean let me not allege that you're one of the worst, but you say ‘Dear Motorists, erm may we congratulate you on the acquisition of your new vehicle.

0000	. And I thought’ Oh dear, where am I going?’
0000	Martin Foyle and Lee Nogan, dear oh dear, they got in each other 's way when there was an empty net in front of them.
